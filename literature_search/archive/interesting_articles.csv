2,19002762,Hydrogen production and anaerobic decolorization of wastewater containing Reactive Blue 4 by a bacterial consortium of Salmonella subterranea and Paenibacillus polymyxa.,"Anaerobic biodegradability of wastewater (3,000 mg CODcr/l) containing 300 mg/l Reactive Blue 4, with different co-substrates, glucose, butyrate and propionate by a bacterial consortium of Salmonella subterranea and Paenibacillus polymyxa, concomitantly with hydrogen production was investigated at 35 degrees C. The accumulative hydrogen production at 3,067 mg CODcr/l was obtained after 7 days of incubation with glucose, sludge, the bacterial consortium. The volatile fatty acids, residual glucose and the total organic carbon were correlated to hydrogen obtained. Interestingly, the bacterial consortium possess decolorization ability showing approximately 24% dye removal after 24 h incubation using glucose as a co-substrate, which was about two and eight times those of butyrate (10%), propionate (12%) and control (3%), respectively. RB4 decolorization occurred through acidogenesis, as high volatile fatty acids but low methane was detected. The bacterial consortium will be the bacterial strains of interest for further decolorization and hydrogen production of industrial waste water.",Biodegradation,2009,None,10.1007/s10532-008-9232-0,1,Defined

KMK-001 that were isolated from acidic coal mine drainage. The structure of 1 was determined to be (3S,10aS)-dithiomethylglionitrin A. This structure was determined by the analyses of extensive NMR data and the circular dichroism spectra of the natural product and a semisynthetic compound derived from glionitrin A. In contrast to glionitrin A (2), glionitrin B (1) is not cytotoxic against the human prostate cancer cell line DU145.

However, their low ethanol conversion efficiency has greatly limited the development and application of natural bacterial consortia.",Biotechnology for biofuels,2015,4308921,10.1186/s13068-014-0186-7,1,Undefined
11,32946127,Consolidated bioprocessing performance of a two-species microbial consortium for butanol production from lignocellulosic biomass.,"Consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) by using microbial consortium was considered as a promising approach to achieve direct biofuel production from lignocellulose. In this study, the interaction mechanism of microbial consortium consisting of Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum M5 and Clostridium acetobutylicum NJ4 was analyzed, which could achieve efficient butanol production from xylan through CBP. Strain M5 possesses efficient xylan degradation capability, as 19.73 g/L of xylose was accumulated within 50 hr. The efficient xylose utilization capability of partner strain NJ4 could relieve the substrate inhibition to hydrolytic enzymes of xylanase and xylosidase secreted by strain M5. In addition, the earlier solventogenesis of strain NJ4 was observed due to the existence of butyrate generated by strain M5. The mutual interaction of these two strains finally gave 13.28 g/L of butanol from 70 g/L of xylan after process optimization, representing a relatively high butanol production from hemicellulose. Moreover, 7.61 g/L of butanol was generated from untreated corncob via CBP. This successfully constructed microbial consortium exhibits efficient cooperation performance on butanol production from lignocellulose, which could provide a platform for the emerging butanol production from lignocellulose.",Biotechnology and bioengineering,2020,None,10.1002/bit.27464,1,Defined
12,32090083,Statistical Experimental Design Optimization of Microbial Proteases Production under Co-Culture Conditions for Chitin Recovery from Speckled Shrimp <i>Metapenaeus monoceros</i> By-Product.,"This study was designed with the aim to produce microbial proteases in presence of speckled shrimp by-product. For this reason, three strains belonging to <i>Bacillus</i> genus, namely, <i>Aeribacillus pallidus</i> VP3, <i>Lysinibacillus fusiformis</i> C250R, and <i>Anoxybacillus kamchatkensis</i> M1V were studied under co-culture procedure. A Taguchi L27 experimental design was applied to optimize the co-culture parameters. The experimental design was built with 9 factors (by-product powder concentration, the pH of the medium, the temperature, the sucrose concentration, the agitation speed, the inoculum sizes of VP3, M1V, and C250R strains, and the culture volume) at three different levels. The obtained results showed that a total protease activity of 8,182 U/mL could be achieved after 24 h of incubation in presence of 20 g/L shrimp by-product and 10 g/L sucrose, at an initial pH of 7, a 40°C temperature and absorbance, at 600 nm, of inoculum sizes of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.1 for VP3, M1V, and C250R strains, respectively. The agitation was set at 200 rpm, and the final volume was 25 mL. Taguchi's design allowed the identification of temperature, the inoculum size for strain VP3, the inoculum size for strain M1V, and the final culture volume as the most influencing variables. A Box-Behnken design with 27 experiments was carried out for the optimization of these four selected factors. Following such design, the highest protease production reached was 11,300 U/mL. This yield was obtained in a final culture volume of 15 mL containing 20 g/L shrimp by-product powder and 10 g/L sucrose and inoculated with VP3, C250R, and M1V strains at 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2, respectively. The flasks were incubated at 45°C for 24 h with shaking at 200 rpm. The efficiency of chitin extraction by co-cultivation was investigated under the latter conditions.

16,33990298,Propionate Production from Carbon Monoxide by Synthetic Cocultures of Acetobacterium wieringae and Propionigenic Bacteria.,"Gas fermentation is a promising way to convert CO-rich gases to chemicals. We studied the use of synthetic cocultures composed of carboxydotrophic and propionigenic bacteria to convert CO to propionate. So far, isolated carboxydotrophs cannot directly ferment CO to propionate, and therefore, this cocultivation approach was investigated. Four distinct synthetic cocultures were constructed, consisting of Acetobacterium wieringae (DSM 1911<sup>T</sup>) and Pelobacter propionicus (DSM 2379<sup>T</sup>), <i>Ac. wieringae</i> (DSM 1911<sup>T</sup>) and Anaerotignum neopropionicum (DSM 3847<sup>T</sup>), <i>Ac. wieringae</i> strain JM and <i>P. propionicus</i> (DSM 2379<sup>T</sup>), and <i>Ac. wieringae</i> strain JM and <i>An. neopropionicum</i> (DSM 3847<sup>T</sup>). Propionate was produced by all the cocultures, with the highest titer (∼24 mM) being measured in the coculture composed of <i>Ac. wieringae</i> strain JM and <i>An. neopropionicum</i>, which also produced isovalerate (∼4 mM), butyrate (∼1 mM), and isobutyrate (0.3 mM). This coculture was further studied using proteogenomics. As expected, enzymes involved in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway in <i>Ac. wieringae</i> strain JM, which are responsible for the conversion of CO to ethanol and acetate, were detected; the proteome of <i>An. neopropionicum</i> confirmed the conversion of ethanol to propionate via the acrylate pathway. In addition, proteins related to amino acid metabolism and stress response were highly abundant during cocultivation, which raises the hypothesis that amino acids are exchanged by the two microorganisms, accompanied by isovalerate and isobutyrate production. This highlights the importance of explicitly looking at fortuitous microbial interactions during cocultivation to fully understand coculture behavior. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Syngas fermentation has great potential for the sustainable production of chemicals from wastes (via prior gasification) and flue gases containing CO/CO<sub>2</sub>. Research efforts need to be directed toward expanding the product portfolio of gas fermentation, which is currently limited to mainly acetate and ethanol. This study provides the basis for a microbial process to produce propionate from CO using synthetic cocultures composed of acetogenic and propionigenic bacteria and elucidates the metabolic pathways involved. Furthermore, based on proteomics results, we hypothesize that the two bacterial species engage in an interaction that results in amino acid exchange, which subsequently promotes isovalerate and isobutyrate production. These findings provide a new understanding of gas fermentation and a coculturing strategy for expanding the product spectrum of microbial conversion of CO/CO<sub>2</sub>.",Applied and environmental microbiology,2021,8231444,10.1128/AEM.02839-20,1,Defined
17,28429329,Hydrogen production and microbial kinetics of Clostridium termitidis in mono-culture and co-culture with Clostridium beijerinckii on cellulose.,"Cellulose utilization by hydrogen producers remains an issue due to the low hydrogen yields reported and the pretreatment of cellulose prior to fermentation requires complex and expensive steps. Clostridium termitidis is able to breakdown cellulose into glucose and produce hydrogen. On the other hand, Clostridium beijerinckii is not able to degrade cellulose but is adept at hydrogen production from glucose; therefore, it was chosen to potentially enhance hydrogen production when co-cultured with C. termitidis on cellulose. In this study, batch fermentation tests were conducted to investigate the direct hydrogen production enhancement of mesophilic cellulolytic bacteria C. termitidis co-cultured with mesophilic hydrogen producer C. beijerinckii on cellulose at 2 g l<sup>-1</sup> compared to C. termitidis mono-culture. Microbial kinetics parameters were determined by modeling in MATLAB. The achieved highest hydrogen yield was 1.92 mol hydrogen mol<sup>-1</sup> hexose equivalent<sub>added</sub> in the co-culture compared to 1.45 mol hydrogen mol<sup>-1</sup> hexose equivalent<sub>added</sub> in the mono-culture. The maximum hydrogen production rate of 26 ml d<sup>-1</sup> was achieved in the co-culture. Co-culture exhibited an overall 32 % enhancement of hydrogen yield based on hexose equivalent added and 15 % more substrate utilization. The main metabolites were acetate, ethanol, lactate, and formate in the mono-culture, with also butyrate in the co-culture. Additionally, the hydrogen yield of C. beijerinckii only in glucose was 2.54 mol hydrogen mol<sup>-1</sup> hexose equivalent. This study has proved the viability of co-culture of C. termitidis with C. beijerinckii for hydrogen production directly from a complex substrate like cellulose under mesophilic conditions.",AMB Express,2017,5399015,10.1186/s13568-016-0256-2,1,Defined

A bioreactor in which a fraction of the return sludge was exposed to repeated heat treatments performed better than a control bioreactor without repeated heat treatment of return sludge and produced a yield of 2.15 moles of hydrogen per mole of sucrose, with 50% hydrogen in the biogas. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis showed that two different Clostridium groups (comprised of one or more species) were dominant during hydrogen production. The relative abundance of two other non-Clostridium groups increased during periods of decreased hydrogen production. The first group consisted of Bifidobacterium thermophilum, and the second group included one or more of Bacillus, Melissococcus, Spirochaeta, and Spiroplasma spp.",Water environment research : a research publication of the Water Environment Federation,2007,None,10.2175/106143007x175762,1,Undefined

22,30060435,Kinetics and microbial community analysis for hydrogen production using raw grass inoculated with different pretreated mixed culture.,"In this study, five pretreatment methods (heat shock, acid, base, aeration and gamma radiation) were applied for enriching hydrogen producers from anaerobically digested sludge, aiming to compare their hydrogen fermentation performance using raw ryegrass as substrate. Results showed that various pretreatment methods caused great variations on grass hydrogen fermentation performance. Acid pretreatment was most efficient compared with other tested pretreatment methods, with relevant hydrogen yield of 64.4mL/g dry grass and organics removal of 31.4%. Kinetics results showed that the first-order kinetic model fitted hydrogen evolution better than the modified Gompertz model. Microbiological analysis showed that various pretreatment methods caused great variations on microbial activity and microbial community composition. Clostridium and Enterococcus were two dominant genera, while relative abundances of these two genera varied greatly for different pretreated samples. Difference in microbial activity and microbial community distribution induced by the pretreatment methods might directly cause different ryegrass fermentation performance.",Bioresource technology,2018,None,10.1016/j.biortech.2017.09.041,1,Undefined

In-depth microbiome characterization was also conducted by high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene using the Miseq Illumina platform. SCOA production was 47.3 % higher in vinasse-fed reactors, with isobutyric (up to 10.3 g L<sup>-1</sup>) and butyric (up to 10.6 g L<sup>-1</sup>) acids as the primary metabolites most likely resulting from lactate conversion. Ethanol comprised the main product from solventogenic pathways in all conditions, with values ranging between 2.7 and 5.2 g L<sup>-1</sup>, whereas no butanol was detected. Microbial analyses revealed high relative abundance values for the Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Bacillus and Ruminococcus genera, with the predominance of the Clostridium genus (17%) in acid-thermal treatment reactors and the Lactobacillus genus (37%) in thermal treatment reactors. Overall, vinasse proved to be a suitable substrate for value-added SCOA production, which characterizes a potential management approach to this wastewater stream. In this sense, the biochemical production of butyrate from vinasse could diversify the product portfolio of sugarcane biorefineries, also minimizing bioenergy losses by converting residual carbon fractions.",Journal of bioscience and bioengineering,2019,None,10.1016/j.jbiosc.2018.10.008,1,Undefined
24,15558274,H2-producing bacterial communities from a heat-treated soil inoculum.,"Hydrogen gas (approximately 60% H(2)) was produced in a continuous flow bioreactor inoculated with heat-treated soil, and fed synthetic wastewater containing glucose (9.5 g l(-1)). The pH in the bioreactor was maintained at 5.5 to inhibit consumption of H(2) by methanogens. The objective of this study was to characterize bacterial communities in the reactor operated under two different hydraulic retention times (HRTs of 30-h and 10-h) and temperatures (30 degrees C and 37 degrees C). At 30-h HRT, the H(2) production rate was 80 ml h(-1) and yield was 0.91 mol H(2)/mol glucose. At 10-h HRT, the H(2) production rate was more than 5 times higher at 436 ml h(-1), and yield was 1.61 mol H(2)/mol glucose. Samples were removed from the reactor under steady-state conditions for PCR-based detection of bacterial populations by ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (RISA). Populations detected at 30-h HRT were more diverse than at 10-h HRT and included representatives of Bacillaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae. At 10-h HRT, only Clostridiaceae were detected. When the temperature of the 10-h HRT reactor was increased from 30 degrees C to 37 degrees C, the steady-state H(2) production rate increased slightly to 463 ml h(-1) and yield was 1.8 mol H(2)/mol glucose. Compared to 30 degrees C, RISA fingerprints at 37 degrees C from the 10-h HRT bioreactor exhibited a clear shift from populations related to Clostridium acidisoli (subcluster Ic) to populations related to Clostridium acetobutylicum (subcluster Ib).",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2004,None,10.1007/s00253-004-1666-7,1,Undefined

30,26547811,Semi-continuous methane production from undiluted brown algae using a halophilic marine microbial community.,"Acclimated marine sediment-derived culture was used for semi-continuous methane production from materials equivalent to raw brown algae, without dilution of salinity and without nutrient supply, under 3 consecutive conditions of varying organic loading rates (OLRs) and hydraulic retention time (HRT). Methane production was stable at 2.0gVS/kg/day (39-day HRT); however, it became unstable at 2.9gVS/kg/day (28-day HRT) due to acetate and propionate accumulation. OLR subsequently decreased to 1.7gVS/kg/day (46-day HRT), stabilizing methane production beyond steady state. Methane yield was above 300mL/g VS at all OLRs. These results indicated that the acclimated marine sediment culture was able to produce methane semi-continuously from raw brown algae without dilution and nutrient supply under steady state. Microbial community analysis suggested that hydrogenotrophic methanogens predominated among archaea during unstable methane production, implying a partial shift of the methanogenic pathway from acetoclastic methanogenesis to acetate oxidation.

In this study, the possibility of biohydrogen production from antibiotic fermentation residue was evaluated, the process efficiency and microbial community dynamics with five different inoculum pretreatments (alkaline, γ-radiation, heat-shock, aeration and acid) were assessed. Results showed that alkaline pretreatment was most efficient for hydrogen fermentation, and the hydrogen yield, volatile solids (VS) removal and maximal hydrogen production rate reached 17.8 mL/g-VS<sub>added</sub>, 17.8% and 3.79 mL/h, respectively. Different inoculum pretreatments led to a obvious variation in the fermentation pathway and microbial community structure.

36,11762604,Microbial community in anaerobic hydrogen-producing microflora enriched from sludge compost.,"Hydrogen production by thermophilic anaerobic microflora enriched from sludge compost was studied by using an artificial medium containing cellulose powder. Hydrogen gas was evolved with the formation of acetate, ethanol, and butyrate by decomposition of the cellulose powder. The hydrogen production yield was 2.0 mol/mol-hexose by either batch or chemostat cultivation. A medium that did not contain peptone demonstrated a lower hydrogen production yield of 1.0 mol/mol-hexose with less formation of butyrate. The microbial community in the microflora was investigated through isolation of the microorganisms by both plating and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of the' PCR-amplified V3 region of 16S rDNA. Sixty-eight microorganisms were isolated from the microflora and classified into nine distinct groups by genetic fingerprinting of the PCR-DGGE or by a random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis and determination of the partial sequence of 16S rDNA. Most of the isolates belonged to the cluster of the thermophilic Clostridium/Bacillus subphylum of low G+C gram-positive bacteria. Product formation by most of the isolated strains corresponded to that produced by the microflora. Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticium was isolated in the enrichment culture with or without added peptone. and was detected with strong intensity by PCR-DGGE. Two other thermophilic cellulolytic microorganisms, Clostridium thermocellum and Clostridium cellulosi, were also detected by PCR-DGGE, although they could not be isolated.

37,33329449,Function-Driven Design of Lactic Acid Bacteria Co-cultures to Produce New Fermented Food Associating Milk and Lupin.,"Designing bacterial co-cultures adapted to ferment mixes of vegetal and animal resources for food diversification and sustainability is becoming a challenge. Among bacteria used in food fermentation, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are good candidates, as they are used as starter or adjunct in numerous fermented foods, where they allow preservation, enhanced digestibility, and improved flavor. We developed here a strategy to design LAB co-cultures able to ferment a new food made of bovine milk and lupin flour, consisting in: (i) <i>in silico</i> preselection of LAB species for targeted carbohydrate degradation; (ii) <i>in vitro</i> screening of 97 strains of the selected species for their ability to ferment carbohydrates and hydrolyze proteins from milk and lupin and clustering strains that displayed similar phenotypes; and (iii) assembling strains randomly sampled from clusters that showed complementary phenotypes. The designed co-cultures successfully expressed the targeted traits i.e., hydrolyzed proteins and degraded raffinose family oligosaccharides of lupin and lactose of milk in a large range of concentrations. They also reduced an off-flavor-generating volatile, hexanal, and produced various desirable flavor compounds.

Stable electricity production was observed after 300 h for communities enriched from lactate, acetate, and formate, while communities enriched with succinate, NAG, and uridine stabilized only after 700 h. The average peak current densities and maximum power densities generated from bacterial consortia were significantly higher than those generated from pure cultures of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. Microbial assemblages were analyzed by DGGE, and planktonic and anode-attached bacterial communities varied as a function of electron donors: Firmicutes, β-Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes dominated the planktonic bacterial communities while anode-attached communities consisted mainly of δ-Proteobacteria, β-Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes. Similar bacterial populations were enriched in MFCs fed with lactate, NAG, and uridine and with succinate, acetate, and formate. Cross-feeding experiments with different fuels indicated that enriched microbial consortia were able to utilize a variety of fuel sources and displayed considerable stability, efficiency, and robustness of power generation in comparison to pure cultures.

53,22864434,Effects of heat treatment on microbial communities of granular sludge for biological hydrogen production.,"Dark fermentation shares many features with anaerobic digestion with the exception that to maximize hydrogen production, methanogens and hydrogen-consuming bacteria should be inhibited. Heat treatment is widely applied as an inoculum pre-treatment due to its effectiveness in inhibiting methanogenic microflora but it may not exclusively select for hydrogen-producing bacteria. This work evaluated the effects of heat treatment on microbial viability and structure of anaerobic granular sludge. Heat treatment was carried out on granular sludge at 100 °C with four residence times (0.5, 1, 2 and 4 h). Hydrogen production of treated sludges was studied from glucose by means of batch test at different pH values. Results indicated that each heat treatment strongly influenced the granular sludge resulting in microbial communities having different hydrogen productions. The highest hydrogen yields (2.14 moles of hydrogen per mole of glucose) were obtained at pH 5.5 using the sludge treated for 4 h characterized by the lowest CFU concentration (2.3 × 10(3)CFU/g sludge). This study demonstrated that heat treatment should be carefully defined according to the structure of the sludge microbial community, allowing the selection of highly efficient hydrogen-producing microbes.",Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,2012,None,10.2166/wst.2012.336,1,Undefined
54,32624809,"High tolerance to glycerol and high production of 1,3-propanediol in batch fermentations by microbial consortium from marine sludge.","1,3-Propanediol (1,3-PD) is a versatile bulk chemical and widely used as a monomer to synthesis polymers, such as polyesters, polyethers and polyurethanes. 1,3-PD can be produced by microbial fermentation with the advantages of the environmental protection and sustainable development. Low substrate tolerance and wide by-product profile limit microbial production of 1,3-PD by <i>Klebsiella pneumonia</i> on industrial scale. In this study, microbial consortia were investigated to overcome some disadvantages of pure fermentation by single strain. Microbial consortium named DL38 from marine sludge gave the best performance. Its bacterial community composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon high-throughput sequencing and showed that <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> was the most abundant family. Compared with three <i>K. pneumonia</i> strains isolated from DL38, the microbial consortium could grow well at an initial glycerol concentration of 200 g/L to produce 81.40 g/L of 1,3-PD with a yield of 0.63 mol/mol. This initial glycerol concentration is twice the highest concentration by single isolated strain and more than the critical value (188 g/L) extrapolated from the fermentation kinetics for <i>K. pneumonia</i>. On the other hand, a small amount of by-products were produced in batch fermentation of microbial consortium DL38,  especially no 2,3-butanediol detected. The mixed culture of strain W3, Y5 and Y1 improved the tolerance to glycerol and changed the metabolite profile of single strain W3. The batch fermentation with the natural proportion (W3: Y5: Y1 = 208: 82: 17) was superior to that with other proportions and single strain. This study showed that microbial consortium DL38 possessed excellent substrate tolerance, narrow by-product profile and attractive potential for industrial production of 1,3-PD.",Engineering in life sciences,2017,6999268,10.1002/elsc.201600215,1,Undefined

In the present study, 3 microbial strains with different oxygen requirements, including Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824, Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 13047 and Kluyveromyces marxianus 15D, were used to construct a hydrogen production system that was composed of a mixed aerobic-facultative anaerobic-anaerobic consortium. The effects of metal ions, organic acids and carbohydrate substrates on this system were analyzed and compared using electrochemical and kinetic assays. It was then tested using small-scale experiments to evaluate its ability to convert starch in 5 L of organic wastewater into hydrogen. For the one-step biohydrogen production experiment, H1 medium (nutrient broth and potato dextrose broth) was mixed directly with GAM broth to generate H2 medium (H1 medium and GAM broth).

Under batch co-digestion, the highest co-digestion synergy was observed for a mixture of 25% food waste and 75% algal biomass. During semi-continuous co-digestion of 25% food waste-75% algal biomass mixture, biochar amended digesters exhibited a 12-54% increase in average methane yield (275.8-394.6 mL/gVS) compared to the controls. Elevated temperature induced narrow distributions of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) by inhibiting the production of branched VFAs. Genus Proteiniphilum was selectively enriched by 3.2 folds in mesophilic digesters with biochar amendment while genus Defluviitoga was selectively enriched in thermophilic digesters due to elevated temperature. Methanogenic communities were significantly different in mesophilic and thermophilic digesters. Biochar amendment contributed to shifts in the predominant methanogens leading to a more balanced state of two methanogenic pathways.",Bioresource technology,2020,None,10.1016/j.biortech.2020.122892,1,Undefined
57,25693426,Optimization of Chlorella vulgaris and bioflocculant-producing bacteria co-culture: enhancing microalgae harvesting and lipid content.,"Microalgae are a sustainable bioresource, and the biofuel they produce is widely considered to be an alternative to limited natural fuel resources. However, microalgae harvesting is a bottleneck in the development of technology. Axenic Chlorella vulgaris microalgae exhibit poor harvesting, as expressed by a flocculation efficiency of 0·2%. This work optimized the co-culture conditions of C. vulgaris and bioflocculant-producing bacteria in synthetic wastewater using response surface methodology (RSM), thus aiming to enhance C. vulgaris harvesting and lipid content. Three significant process variables- inoculation ratio of bacteria and microalgae, initial glucose concentration, and co-culture time- were proposed in the RSM model. F-values (3·98/8·46) and R(2) values (0·7817/0·8711) both indicated a reasonable prediction by the RSM model. The results showed that C. vulgaris harvesting efficiency reached 45·0-50·0%, and the lipid content was over 21·0% when co-cultured with bioflocculant-producing bacteria under the optimized culture conditions of inoculation ratio of bacteria and microalgae of 0·20-0·25, initial glucose concentration of <1·5 kg m(-3) and co-culture time of 9-14 days.

62,23959872,Design and characterization of synthetic fungal-bacterial consortia for direct production of isobutanol from cellulosic biomass.,"Synergistic microbial communities are ubiquitous in nature and exhibit appealing features, such as sophisticated metabolic capabilities and robustness. This has inspired fast-growing interest in engineering synthetic microbial consortia for biotechnology development. However, there are relatively few reports of their use in real-world applications, and achieving population stability and regulation has proven to be challenging. In this work, we bridge ecology theory with engineering principles to develop robust synthetic fungal-bacterial consortia for efficient biosynthesis of valuable products from lignocellulosic feedstocks. The required biological functions are divided between two specialists: the fungus Trichoderma reesei, which secretes cellulase enzymes to hydrolyze lignocellulosic biomass into soluble saccharides, and the bacterium Escherichia coli, which metabolizes soluble saccharides into desired products. We developed and experimentally validated a comprehensive mathematical model for T. reesei/E. coli consortia, providing insights on key determinants of the system's performance. To illustrate the bioprocessing potential of this consortium, we demonstrate direct conversion of microcrystalline cellulose and pretreated corn stover to isobutanol. Without costly nutrient supplementation, we achieved titers up to 1.88 g/L and yields up to 62% of theoretical maximum. In addition, we show that cooperator-cheater dynamics within T. reesei/E. coli consortia lead to stable population equilibria and provide a mechanism for tuning composition. Although we offer isobutanol production as a proof-of-concept application, our modular system could be readily adapted for production of many other valuable biochemicals.

63,18226523,Anaerobic biohydrogen production from monosaccharides by a mixed microbial community culture.,"Monosaccharides (e.g. glucose and fructose) are produced from the hydrolyzation of macromolecules, such as starch, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, which are abundant in various industrial wastewaters. The elucidation of anaerobic activated sludge microbial community utilizing monosaccharides will lay an important foundation for the industrialization of biohydrogen production. In this study, the hydrogen production by a mixed microbial culture on four monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, galactose and arabinose) was investigated in a batch cultures. The mixed microbial culture was obtained from anaerobic activated sludge in a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) after 29 days of acclimatization. The results indicated that glucose had the highest specific hydrogen production rate of 358 mL/g.g mixed liquid volatile suspended solid (MLVSS), while arabinose had the lowest hydrogen production rate of 28 mL/g.gMLVSS. Glucose also possessed the highest specific conversion rate to hydrogen of 82 mL/g glucose, while fructose had the highest specific conversion rate to liquid product of 443 mg/g fructose. Arabinose had the lowest conversion rates to both liquid products and hydrogen. Metabolic pathways and fermentation products were the major reasons for the difference in hydrogen production from these four monosaccharides. The complex fermentation pathways of arabinose reduced its hydrogen production efficiency and a long acclimation period (over 68 h) was required before the anaerobic activated sludge could effectively utilize arabinose in batch cultures.",Bioresource technology,2008,None,10.1016/j.biortech.2007.11.072,1,Undefined

The results showed that the anaerobic co-digestion of these materials enhanced the hydrogen content by 62.4% (v/v), 29.89% higher than that obtained by FW digestion alone, and the total VFA production reached at 281.84 mg/g volatile solid (VS), a 8.38% increase. This enhancement was primarily resulted from improvements in the multi-substrate characteristics, which were obtained by supplying a higher soluble chemical oxygen demand (23.78-32.14 g/L) and suitable a pH (6.12-6.51), decreasing total ammonia nitrogen by 18.67% and ensuring a proper carbon/nitrogen ratio (15.01-23.01). Furthermore, maximal hydrogen (62.39 mL/g VS) and total VFA production potential (294.63 mg/g VS) were estimated using response surface methodology optimization, which yielded FW percentages of 85.17% and 79.87%, respectively. Based on a pyrosequencing analysis, the dominant bacteria associated with VFA and hydrogen production were promoted under optimized condition, including members of genera Veillonella and Clostridium and the orders Bacteroidales and Lactobacillales.","Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2018,None,10.1016/j.wasman.2018.06.046,1,Undefined
67,23831709,Bispecific antibodies with natural architecture produced by co-culture of bacteria expressing two distinct half-antibodies.,"By enabling the simultaneous engagement of two distinct targets, bispecific antibodies broaden the potential utility of antibody-based therapies. However, bispecific-antibody design and production remain challenging, owing to the need to incorporate two distinct heavy and light chain pairs while maintaining natural nonimmunogenic antibody architecture. Here we present a bispecific-antibody production strategy that relies on co-culture of two bacterial strains, each expressing a half-antibody. Using this approach, we produce 28 unique bispecific antibodies. A bispecific antibody against the receptor tyrosine kinases MET and EGFR binds both targets monovalently, inhibits their signaling, and suppresses MET and EGFR-driven cell and tumor growth. Our strategy allows rapid generation of bispecific antibodies from any two existing antibodies and yields milligram to gram quantities of bispecific antibodies sufficient for a wide range of discovery and preclinical applications.

69,29205274,Production of cellulosic organic acids via synthetic fungal consortia.,"Consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) is a potential breakthrough technology for reducing costs of biochemical production from lignocellulosic biomass. Production of cellulase enzymes, saccharification of lignocellulose, and conversion of the resulting sugars into a chemical of interest occur simultaneously within a single bioreactor. In this study, synthetic fungal consortia composed of the cellulolytic fungus Trichoderma reesei and the production specialist Rhizopus delemar demonstrated conversion of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and alkaline pre-treated corn stover (CS) to fumaric acid in a fully consolidated manner without addition of cellulase enzymes or expensive supplements such as yeast extract. A titer of 6.87 g/L of fumaric acid, representing 0.17 w/w yield, were produced from 40 g/L MCC with a productivity of 31.8 mg/L/hr.

The C. roseum H5 (glucose-consuming) and C. butyricum R4 (protein-degrading) co-culture was the best hydrogen-producing co-culture. The end-fermentation products for the axenic cultures and co-cultures were analyzed. In all cases, organic acids, mainly butyrate and acetate, were produced lowering the pH and thus inhibiting further hydrogen production. In order to replace the need for reducing agents for the anaerobic growth of clostridia, a microbial consortium including Clostridium spp. and an oxygen-consuming microorganism able to form dense granules (Streptomyces sp.) was created.

Succinate and acetate produced by the cellulolytic organisms were converted to butyrate and caproate only when the culture medium was supplemented with ethanol. Ethanol (244 mM) and butyrate (30 mM at pH 6.8) did not inhibit cellulose digestion or product formation by S85 or FD-1; however caproate (30 mM at pH 6.8) was moderately inhibitory to FD-1. Succinate consumption and caproate production were sensitive to culture pH, with more caproic acid being produced when the culture was controlled at a pH near neutrality. In a representative experiment under conditions of controlled pH (at 6.8) 6.0 g cellulose l-1 and 4.4 g ethanol l-1 were converted to 2.6 g butyrate l-1 and 4.6 g caproate l-1. The results suggest that bacteria that efficiently produce low levels of ethanol and acetate or succinate from cellulose should be useful in cocultures for the production of caproic acid, a potentially useful industrial chemical and bio-fuel precursor.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,1995,None,10.1007/s002530050590,1,Defined

Uptake of cathodic electrons is particularly important in microbial electrosynthesis of sustainable fuel and chemical precursors using only CO<sub>2</sub> and electricity as carbon, electron and energy source. Typically, large overpotentials (200 to 400 mV) were reported to be required for cathodic electron uptake during electrosynthesis of, for example, methane and acetate, or low electrosynthesis rates were observed. To address these limitations and to explore conceptual alternatives, we studied defined co-cultures metabolizing cathodic electrons. The Fe(0)-corroding strain IS4 was used to catalyze the electron uptake reaction from the cathode forming molecular hydrogen as intermediate, and Methanococcus maripaludis and Acetobacterium woodii were used as model microorganisms for hydrogenotrophic synthesis of methane and acetate, respectively.
