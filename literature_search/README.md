# Literature search

Dataset of publications collected by ... (#TODO: explain), manually curated.
Dataset is stored in the files [all_articles](all_articles.csv) and [defined_articles](defined_articles.csv).

Python scrips include utility functions for plotting, [plot_generator](plot_generator.ipynb) used to generate plots.
[co-occurence_metrics](co-occurence_metrics.ipynb) used for network analysis.

Archive and data exploration notebooks contain old attempts and code which should be ignored.
