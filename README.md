# BIOTBT3900
Master project in systems biology on the topic of metabolic modelling of microbial communities.  
By Andrea Stallvik, completed in 2024.

The project consists of three main setions:

1. [Literature search](literature_search)  
Analysis of a dataset of publications involving
1. Case-study: [Rosmarinic Acid](community_modelling/RAsynthesis)  
Model building and simulation of consortia from [Balancing the non-linear rosmarinic acid biosynthetic pathway by modular co-culture engineering](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2019.03.002).
1. Case-study: [Butanol production](community_modelling/CBP_butanol)  
Model building and simulation of the consortium from [Consolidated bioprocessing performance of a two-species microbial consortium for butanol production from lignocellulosic biomass](https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.27464).
