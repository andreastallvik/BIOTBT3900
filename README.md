# MSc project
A masters project in systems biology on the topic of metabolic modelling of microbial communities.  
By Andrea Stallvik, completed in 2024 at NTNU.

The project consists of three main modules:

1. [Literature search](literature_search)  
Analysis of a dataset of publications where a microbial community was used to produce a target compound.
1. Case study: [Rosmarinic Acid production](community_modelling/RAsynthesis)  
Model construction and simulation of consortia from [Balancing the non-linear rosmarinic acid biosynthetic pathway by modular co-culture engineering](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2019.03.002).
1. Case study: [Butanol production](community_modelling/CBP_butanol)  
Model constriction and simulation of the consortium from [Consolidated bioprocessing performance of a two-species microbial consortium for butanol production from lignocellulosic biomass](https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.27464).
