The conventional production methods are facing increasing economy, sustainability and environmental challenges. Therefore, developing a green synthesis method converting renewable feedstocks to indigo using engineered microbes is of great research and application interest. However, the efficiency of the indigo microbial biosynthesis is still low and needs to be improved by proper metabolic engineering strategies.",Microbial cell factories,2021,8336371,10.1186/s12934-021-01636-w,1,Defined,Glycerol,Indigo,Escherichia coli,,

This study aimed to evaluate the potential of the co-culture of two halophilic bacteria, <i>Marinirhabdus</i> sp. and <i>Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus</i> for enhanced protease activity. The co-culture was significantly more productive than monoculture (1.6-2.0 times more growth), with <i>Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus</i> being predominant (64%). In terms of protease activity, enhanced total activity (1.8-2.4 times) was observed in the co-culture. Importantly, protease activity in the co-culture was found to remain active over a much broader range of environmental conditions (temperature 25 °C to 60 °C, pH 4-12, and 10-30% salinity, respectively). This study confirms that the co-culturing of halophilic bacteria represents an economical approach as it resulted in both increased biomass and protease production, the latter which showed activity over arange of environmental conditions.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,8197384,10.3390/molecules26113141,1,Defined,Casein,Protease,"Marinirhabdus sp, Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus",,

Binary consortia were designed to mimic a ubiquitous, naturally occurring ecological template of primary productivity supported by secondary consumption. The synthetic consortia replicated this evolution-proven strategy by combining a glucose positive E. coli strain, which served as the system's primary producer, with a glucose negative E. coli strain which consumed metabolic byproducts from the primary producer. The engineered consortia utilized strategic division of labor to simultaneously optimize multiple tasks enhancing overall culture performance. Consortial interactions resulted in the emergent property of enhanced system biomass productivity which was demonstrated with three distinct culturing systems: batch, chemostat and biofilm growth. Glucose-based biomass productivity increased by ∼15, 20 and 50% compared to appropriate monoculture controls for these three culturing systems, respectively. Interestingly, the consortial interactions also produced biofilms with predictable, self-assembling, laminated microstructures. This study establishes a metabolic engineering paradigm which can be easily adapted to existing E. coli based bioprocesses to improve productivity based on a robust ecological theme.",Journal of biotechnology,2012,3549274,10.1016/j.jbiotec.2011.10.001,1,Defined,Glucose,Biomass,Escherichia coli,,

34370382,Adaptive laboratory evolution of microbial co-cultures for improved metabolite secretion.,"Adaptive laboratory evolution has proven highly effective for obtaining microorganisms with enhanced capabilities. Yet, this method is inherently restricted to the traits that are positively linked to cell fitness, such as nutrient utilization. Here, we introduce coevolution of obligatory mutualistic communities for improving secretion of fitness-costly metabolites through natural selection. In this strategy, metabolic cross-feeding connects secretion of the target metabolite, despite its cost to the secretor, to the survival and proliferation of the entire community. We thus co-evolved wild-type lactic acid bacteria and engineered auxotrophic Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a synthetic growth medium leading to bacterial isolates with enhanced secretion of two B-group vitamins, viz., riboflavin and folate. The increased production was specific to the targeted vitamin, and evident also in milk, a more complex nutrient environment that naturally contains vitamins. Genomic, proteomic and metabolomic analyses of the evolved lactic acid bacteria, in combination with flux balance analysis, showed altered metabolic regulation towards increased supply of the vitamin precursors.

32863734,Metabolic modeling of bacterial co-culture systems predicts enhanced carbon monoxide-to-butyrate conversion compared to monoculture systems.,"We used metabolic modeling to computationally investigate the potential of bacterial coculture system designs for CO conversion to the platform chemical butyrate. By taking advantage of the native capabilities of wild-type strains, we developed two anaerobic coculture designs by combining <i>Clostridium autoethanogenum</i> for CO-to-acetate conversion with bacterial strains that offer high acetate-to-butyrate conversion capabilities: the environmental bacterium the human gut bacterium<i>Eubacterium rectale</i>. When grown in continuous stirred tank reactor on a 70/0/30 CO/H<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> gas mixture, the C. autoethanogenum-<i>C Kluyveri</i> co-culture was predicted to offer no mprovement in butyrate volumetric productivity compared to an engineered <i>C. autoethanogenum</i> monoculture despite utilizing vinyl acetate as a secondary carbon source for <i>C. kluyveri</i> growth enhancement. A coculture consisting of <i>C. autoethanogenum</i> and <i>C. kluyveri</i> engineered in silico to eliminate hexanoate synthesis was predicted to enhance both butyrate productivity and titer. The <i>C. autoethanogenum-E. rectale</i> coculture offered similar improvements in butyrate productivity without the need for metabolic engineering when glucose was provided as a secondary carbon source to enhance <i>E. rectale</i> growth.

25470793,Rationally engineered synthetic coculture for improved biomass and product formation.,"In microbial ecosystems, bacteria are dependent on dynamic interspecific interactions related to carbon and energy flow. Substrates and end-metabolites are rapidly converted to other compounds, which protects the community from high concentrations of inhibitory molecules. In biotechnological applications, pure cultures are preferred because of the more straight-forward metabolic engineering and bioprocess control. However, the accumulation of unwanted side products can limit the cell growth and process efficiency. In this study, a rationally engineered coculture with a carbon channeling system was constructed using two well-characterized model strains Escherichia coli K12 and Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1. The directed carbon flow resulted in efficient acetate removal, and the coculture showed symbiotic nature in terms of substrate utilization and growth. Recombinant protein production was used as a proof-of-principle example to demonstrate the coculture utility and the effects on product formation. As a result, the biomass and recombinant protein titers of E. coli were enhanced in both minimal and rich medium simple batch cocultures. Finally, harnessing both the strains to the production resulted in enhanced recombinant protein titers.

30390509,"Shaping microbial consortia in coupling glycerol fermentation and carboxylate chain elongation for Co-production of 1,3-propanediol and caproate: Pathways and mechanisms.","Glycerol is presently being generated in surplus with the rapid growth of the biodiesel industry and seeks ways to be upcycled, rather than to be treated with costs. Glycerol for the co-production of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) and caproate has a great prospect. Yet, its technical difficulty lies in the enhancement of caproate productivity, which requires the presence of ethanol as a co-substrate and necessitates the co-existence of functional microbes for glycerol fermentation and chain elongation. This study successfully achieved 6.38 mM C 1,3-PDO d<sup>-1</sup> and 2.95 mM C caproate d<sup>-1</sup> in a 2-L mixed-cultured semi-continuous fermenter with a glycerol-ethanol-acetate stoichiometric ratio of 4:3:1. Such conversions were mainly facilitated by a microbial community of Eubacterium limosum, Clostridium kluyveri and Massilibacterium senegalense. With such a synergistic microbiome, the co-production of 1,3-PDO and caproate was achieved from glycerol without ethanol addition. Based on metagenomics, E. limosum is capable of converting glycerol to 1,3-PDO, ethanol and H<sub>2</sub>, and also redirecting the electron potential of H<sub>2</sub> into acetate via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, which is then used for chain elongation. C. kluyveri worked synergistically with E. limosum by consuming ethanol and acetate for caproate production. M. senegalense encodes for ethanol oxidation to acetate and butyrate, facilitating the generation of these intermediates for C. kluyveri elongation to caproate. During the transition between fermentation and elongation, an unexpected observation of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) formation and reutilization by M. senegalense may be associated with butyrate formation for further caproate generation.

35730952,Engineering <i>Pseudomonas putida</i> To Produce Rhamnolipid Biosurfactants for Promoting Phenanthrene Biodegradation by a Two-Species Microbial Consortium.,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of organic contaminants that pose a significant environmental hazard. Phenanthrene is one of the model compounds for the study of biodegradation of PAHs. However, the biodegradation of phenanthrene is often limited by its low water solubility and dissolution rate. To overcome this limitation, we engineered a strain of Pseudomonas putida to produce rhamnolipid biosurfactants and thereby promote phenanthrene biodegradation by an engineered strain of Escherichia coli constructed previously in our lab. The E. coli-P. putida two-species consortium exhibited a synergistic effect of these two distinct organisms in degrading phenanthrene, resulting in an increase from 61.15 to 73.86% of the degradation ratio of 100 mg/L phenanthrene within 7 days. After additional optimization of the degradation conditions, the phenanthrene degradation ratio was improved to 85.73%. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are recalcitrant, carcinogenic, and tend to bioaccumulate, are widespread and persistent environmental pollutants. Based on these characteristics, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has listed PAHs as priority contaminants. Although there are many methods to treat PAH pollution, these methods are mostly limited by the poor water solubility of PAHs, which is especially true for the biodegradation process. Recent evidence of PAH-contaminated sites suffering from increasingly severe impact has emerged. As a result, the need to degrade PAHs is becoming urgent. The significance of our study lies in the development of nonpathogenic strains of biosurfactant-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa for promoting the degradation of phenanthrene by engineered Escherichia coli.",Microbiology spectrum,2022,9431653,10.1128/spectrum.00910-22,1,Defined,"Phenanthrene, Glycerol",Biosurfactants,"Pseudomonas putida, Escherichia coli",,
36270363,Model-aided targeted volatile fatty acid production from food waste using a defined co-culture microbial community.,"The production of volatile fatty acids (VFA) is gaining momentum due to their central role in the emerging carboxylate platform. Particularly, the production of the longest VFA (from butyrate to caproate) is desired due to their increased economic value and easier downstream processing. While the use of undefined microbial cultures is usually preferred with organic waste streams, the use of defined microbial co-culture processes could tackle some of their drawbacks such as poor control over the process outcome, which often leads to low selectivity for the desired products. However, the extensive experimentation needed to design a co-culture system hinders the use of this technology. In this work, a workflow based on the combined use of mathematical models and wet experimentation is proposed to accelerate the design of novel bioprocesses. In particular, a co-culture consisting of Pediococcus pentosaceus and Megaphaera cerevisiae is used to target the production of high-value odd- and even‑carbon VFA. An unstructured kinetic model was developed, calibrated and used to design experiments with the goal of increasing the selectivity for the desired VFA, which were experimentally validated. In the case of even‑carbon VFA, the experimental validation showed an increase of 38 % in caproate yield and, in the case of enhanced odd‑carbon VFA experiments, the yield of butyrate and caproate diminished by 62 % and 94 %, respectively, while propionate became one of the main end products and valerate yield value increased from 0.007 to 0.085 g<sub>valearte</sub> per g<sub>consumed sugar.</sub> The workflow followed in this work proved to be a sound tool for bioprocess design due to its capacity to explore and design new experiments in silico in a fast way and ability to quickly adapt to new scenarios.",The Science of the total environment,2023,None,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159521,1,Defined,Food waste,VFA,"Pediococcus pentosaceus, Megaphaera cerevisiae",,

An artificial microbial consortium (AMC) was constructed to produce FW-based lipopeptides in order to investigate the strategy of FW bioconversion into value-added products. Exogenous fatty acids as a precursor significantly improved the lipopeptide production of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens HM618. To enhance fatty acid synthesis and efflux in AMC, the recombinant Yarrowia lipolytica YL21 (strain YL21) was constructed by screening 12 target genes related to fatty acids to replace exogenous fatty acids in order to improve lipopeptide production. The levels of fengycin, surfactin, and iturin A in the AMC of strains HM618 and YL21 reached 76.19, 192.80, and 31.32 mg L<sup>-1</sup>, increasing 7.24-, 12.13-, and 3.23-fold compared to the results from the pure culture of strain HM618 in flask with Landy medium, respectively. Furthermore, free fatty acids were almost undetectable in the co-culture of strains HM618 and YL21, although its level was around 1.25 g L<sup>-1</sup> in the pure culture of strain YL21 with Landy medium. Interestingly, 470.24 mg L<sup>-1</sup> of lipopeptides and 18.11 g L<sup>-1</sup> of fatty acids were co-produced in this AMC in a bioreactor with FW medium.

The purpose of this study was to use pure cultures in combination to identify their potential of PHA production. In this work we used volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and glucose as carbon source to check the ability of selected strains ST2 (Pseudomonas sp.) and CS8 (Bacillus sp.) as co-culture. The production of PHA in pure co-cultures of bacteria was therefore investigated in order to understand the effect of combining cultures on PHA production parameters and material properties. Bacteria could use the feed in better way when mixed as compared to individual strain. In undertaking this analysis, model volatile fatty acids (i.e., acetic and propionic acids) were used alone and in combination with glucose as feedstock. The production by Pseudomonas was 34% while 24% by Bacillus. However when combined and mixed feed (glucose + propionic acid) was used, 35% PHA produced. Overall, it was found that the ability of the pure cultures to produce PHA was low but when selected cultures were mixed, their ability to produce PHA was enhanced. Copolymers were obtained instead of homopolymers with improved properties. This suggests that industrial wastewater rich in volatile fatty acids and carbohydrates can be a good carbon source for PHA production with variable properties.",Journal of basic microbiology,2018,None,10.1002/jobm.201700276,1,Defined,"Glucose, VFA_s",Polyhydroxyalkanoate,"Pseudomonas sp, Bacillus sp",,

However, when a screened microbial community with cellulolytic capacity was added to the consortia to increase the number of strains, it engendered more microbial interactions with the above strains and universally improved the β-glucosidase activity of the consortia. Analysis of the microbial community structure revealed that the bacteria in the consortia are more important for lignocellulolytic enzyme activity than the fungi.

In this study, the interaction mechanism of microbial consortium consisting of Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum M5 and Clostridium acetobutylicum NJ4 was analyzed, which could achieve efficient butanol production from xylan through CBP. Strain M5 possesses efficient xylan degradation capability, as 19.73 g/L of xylose was accumulated within 50 hr. The efficient xylose utilization capability of partner strain NJ4 could relieve the substrate inhibition to hydrolytic enzymes of xylanase and xylosidase secreted by strain M5. In addition, the earlier solventogenesis of strain NJ4 was observed due to the existence of butyrate generated by strain M5. The mutual interaction of these two strains finally gave 13.28 g/L of butanol from 70 g/L of xylan after process optimization, representing a relatively high butanol production from hemicellulose. Moreover, 7.61 g/L of butanol was generated from untreated corncob via CBP.

For this reason, three strains belonging to <i>Bacillus</i> genus, namely, <i>Aeribacillus pallidus</i> VP3, <i>Lysinibacillus fusiformis</i> C250R, and <i>Anoxybacillus kamchatkensis</i> M1V were studied under co-culture procedure. A Taguchi L27 experimental design was applied to optimize the co-culture parameters. The experimental design was built with 9 factors (by-product powder concentration, the pH of the medium, the temperature, the sucrose concentration, the agitation speed, the inoculum sizes of VP3, M1V, and C250R strains, and the culture volume) at three different levels. The obtained results showed that a total protease activity of 8,182 U/mL could be achieved after 24 h of incubation in presence of 20 g/L shrimp by-product and 10 g/L sucrose, at an initial pH of 7, a 40°C temperature and absorbance, at 600 nm, of inoculum sizes of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.1 for VP3, M1V, and C250R strains, respectively. The agitation was set at 200 rpm, and the final volume was 25 mL. Taguchi's design allowed the identification of temperature, the inoculum size for strain VP3, the inoculum size for strain M1V, and the final culture volume as the most influencing variables. A Box-Behnken design with 27 experiments was carried out for the optimization of these four selected factors. Following such design, the highest protease production reached was 11,300 U/mL. This yield was obtained in a final culture volume of 15 mL containing 20 g/L shrimp by-product powder and 10 g/L sucrose and inoculated with VP3, C250R, and M1V strains at 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2, respectively. The flasks were incubated at 45°C for 24 h with shaking at 200 rpm. The efficiency of chitin extraction by co-cultivation was investigated under the latter conditions.

33990298,Propionate Production from Carbon Monoxide by Synthetic Cocultures of Acetobacterium wieringae and Propionigenic Bacteria.,"Gas fermentation is a promising way to convert CO-rich gases to chemicals. We studied the use of synthetic cocultures composed of carboxydotrophic and propionigenic bacteria to convert CO to propionate. So far, isolated carboxydotrophs cannot directly ferment CO to propionate, and therefore, this cocultivation approach was investigated. Four distinct synthetic cocultures were constructed, consisting of Acetobacterium wieringae (DSM 1911<sup>T</sup>) and Pelobacter propionicus (DSM 2379<sup>T</sup>), <i>Ac. wieringae</i> (DSM 1911<sup>T</sup>) and Anaerotignum neopropionicum (DSM 3847<sup>T</sup>), <i>Ac. wieringae</i> strain JM and <i>P. propionicus</i> (DSM 2379<sup>T</sup>), and <i>Ac. wieringae</i> strain JM and <i>An. neopropionicum</i> (DSM 3847<sup>T</sup>). Propionate was produced by all the cocultures, with the highest titer (∼24 mM) being measured in the coculture composed of <i>Ac. wieringae</i> strain JM and <i>An. neopropionicum</i>, which also produced isovalerate (∼4 mM), butyrate (∼1 mM), and isobutyrate (0.3 mM). This coculture was further studied using proteogenomics. As expected, enzymes involved in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway in <i>Ac. wieringae</i> strain JM, which are responsible for the conversion of CO to ethanol and acetate, were detected; the proteome of <i>An. neopropionicum</i> confirmed the conversion of ethanol to propionate via the acrylate pathway. In addition, proteins related to amino acid metabolism and stress response were highly abundant during cocultivation, which raises the hypothesis that amino acids are exchanged by the two microorganisms, accompanied by isovalerate and isobutyrate production. This highlights the importance of explicitly looking at fortuitous microbial interactions during cocultivation to fully understand coculture behavior. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Syngas fermentation has great potential for the sustainable production of chemicals from wastes (via prior gasification) and flue gases containing CO/CO<sub>2</sub>. Research efforts need to be directed toward expanding the product portfolio of gas fermentation, which is currently limited to mainly acetate and ethanol. This study provides the basis for a microbial process to produce propionate from CO using synthetic cocultures composed of acetogenic and propionigenic bacteria and elucidates the metabolic pathways involved. Furthermore, based on proteomics results, we hypothesize that the two bacterial species engage in an interaction that results in amino acid exchange, which subsequently promotes isovalerate and isobutyrate production. These findings provide a new understanding of gas fermentation and a coculturing strategy for expanding the product spectrum of microbial conversion of CO/CO<sub>2</sub>.",Applied and environmental microbiology,2021,8231444,10.1128/AEM.02839-20,1,Defined,"CO, Syngas",Propionate,"Acetobacterium wieringae, Pelobacter propionicus, Anaerotignum neopropionicum",,
28429329,Hydrogen production and microbial kinetics of Clostridium termitidis in mono-culture and co-culture with Clostridium beijerinckii on cellulose.,"Cellulose utilization by hydrogen producers remains an issue due to the low hydrogen yields reported and the pretreatment of cellulose prior to fermentation requires complex and expensive steps. Clostridium termitidis is able to breakdown cellulose into glucose and produce hydrogen. On the other hand, Clostridium beijerinckii is not able to degrade cellulose but is adept at hydrogen production from glucose; therefore, it was chosen to potentially enhance hydrogen production when co-cultured with C. termitidis on cellulose. In this study, batch fermentation tests were conducted to investigate the direct hydrogen production enhancement of mesophilic cellulolytic bacteria C. termitidis co-cultured with mesophilic hydrogen producer C. beijerinckii on cellulose at 2 g l<sup>-1</sup> compared to C. termitidis mono-culture. Microbial kinetics parameters were determined by modeling in MATLAB. The achieved highest hydrogen yield was 1.92 mol hydrogen mol<sup>-1</sup> hexose equivalent<sub>added</sub> in the co-culture compared to 1.45 mol hydrogen mol<sup>-1</sup> hexose equivalent<sub>added</sub> in the mono-culture. The maximum hydrogen production rate of 26 ml d<sup>-1</sup> was achieved in the co-culture. Co-culture exhibited an overall 32 % enhancement of hydrogen yield based on hexose equivalent added and 15 % more substrate utilization. The main metabolites were acetate, ethanol, lactate, and formate in the mono-culture, with also butyrate in the co-culture. Additionally, the hydrogen yield of C. beijerinckii only in glucose was 2.54 mol hydrogen mol<sup>-1</sup> hexose equivalent. This study has proved the viability of co-culture of C. termitidis with C. beijerinckii for hydrogen production directly from a complex substrate like cellulose under mesophilic conditions.",AMB Express,2017,5399015,10.1186/s13568-016-0256-2,1,Defined,Cellulose,Hydrogen,"Clostridium termitidis, Clostridium beijerinckii",,"Cellulose fermentation, Hydrogen production"

23959872,Design and characterization of synthetic fungal-bacterial consortia for direct production of isobutanol from cellulosic biomass.,"Synergistic microbial communities are ubiquitous in nature and exhibit appealing features, such as sophisticated metabolic capabilities and robustness. This has inspired fast-growing interest in engineering synthetic microbial consortia for biotechnology development. However, there are relatively few reports of their use in real-world applications, and achieving population stability and regulation has proven to be challenging. In this work, we bridge ecology theory with engineering principles to develop robust synthetic fungal-bacterial consortia for efficient biosynthesis of valuable products from lignocellulosic feedstocks. The required biological functions are divided between two specialists: the fungus Trichoderma reesei, which secretes cellulase enzymes to hydrolyze lignocellulosic biomass into soluble saccharides, and the bacterium Escherichia coli, which metabolizes soluble saccharides into desired products. We developed and experimentally validated a comprehensive mathematical model for T. reesei/E. coli consortia, providing insights on key determinants of the system's performance. To illustrate the bioprocessing potential of this consortium, we demonstrate direct conversion of microcrystalline cellulose and pretreated corn stover to isobutanol. Without costly nutrient supplementation, we achieved titers up to 1.88 g/L and yields up to 62% of theoretical maximum. In addition, we show that cooperator-cheater dynamics within T. reesei/E. coli consortia lead to stable population equilibria and provide a mechanism for tuning composition. Although we offer isobutanol production as a proof-of-concept application, our modular system could be readily adapted for production of many other valuable biochemicals.

However, bispecific-antibody design and production remain challenging, owing to the need to incorporate two distinct heavy and light chain pairs while maintaining natural nonimmunogenic antibody architecture. Here we present a bispecific-antibody production strategy that relies on co-culture of two bacterial strains, each expressing a half-antibody. Using this approach, we produce 28 unique bispecific antibodies. A bispecific antibody against the receptor tyrosine kinases MET and EGFR binds both targets monovalently, inhibits their signaling, and suppresses MET and EGFR-driven cell and tumor growth. Our strategy allows rapid generation of bispecific antibodies from any two existing antibodies and yields milligram to gram quantities of bispecific antibodies sufficient for a wide range of discovery and preclinical applications.

Uptake of cathodic electrons is particularly important in microbial electrosynthesis of sustainable fuel and chemical precursors using only CO<sub>2</sub> and electricity as carbon, electron and energy source. Typically, large overpotentials (200 to 400 mV) were reported to be required for cathodic electron uptake during electrosynthesis of, for example, methane and acetate, or low electrosynthesis rates were observed. To address these limitations and to explore conceptual alternatives, we studied defined co-cultures metabolizing cathodic electrons. The Fe(0)-corroding strain IS4 was used to catalyze the electron uptake reaction from the cathode forming molecular hydrogen as intermediate, and Methanococcus maripaludis and Acetobacterium woodii were used as model microorganisms for hydrogenotrophic synthesis of methane and acetate, respectively.

27680538,Engineering of a microbial coculture of Escherichia coli strains for the biosynthesis of resveratrol.,"Resveratrol is a plant natural product with many health-protecting effects which makes it an attractive chemical both for academic studies and industrial purposes. However, the low quantities naturally produced by plants as well as the unsustainable procedures of extraction, purification and concentration have prompted many biotechnological approaches to produce this chemical in large quantities from renewable sources. None of these approaches have considered a microbial coculture strategy to produce this compound. The aim of this study was to prove the functionality of a microbial coculture for the biosynthesis of resveratrol.",Microbial cell factories,2016,5041211,10.1186/s12934-016-0562-z,1,Defined,Glycerol,Resveratrol,Escherichia coli,,
