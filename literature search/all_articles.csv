34348711,Development and optimization of a microbial co-culture system for heterologous indigo biosynthesis.,"Indigo is a color molecule with a long history of being used as a textile dye. The conventional production methods are facing increasing economy, sustainability and environmental challenges. Therefore, developing a green synthesis method converting renewable feedstocks to indigo using engineered microbes is of great research and application interest. However, the efficiency of the indigo microbial biosynthesis is still low and needs to be improved by proper metabolic engineering strategies.",Microbial cell factories,2021,8336371,10.1186/s12934-021-01636-w,1,Defined,Glycerol,Indigo,Escherichia coli,Enterobacteriaceae
34656153,Comprehensive evaluation for the one-pot biosynthesis of butyl acetate by using microbial mono- and co-cultures.,"Butyl acetate has shown wide applications in food, cosmetics, medicine, and biofuel sectors. These short-chain fatty acid esters can be produced by either chemical or biological synthetic process with corresponding alcohols and acids. Currently, biosynthesis of short chain fatty acid esters, such as butyl butyrate, through microbial fermentation systems has been achieved; however, few studies regarding biosynthesis of butyl acetate were reported.",Biotechnology for biofuels,2021,8520270,10.1186/s13068-021-02053-2,1,Defined,Glucose,Butyl acetate,"Clostridium acetobutylicum, Actinobacillus succinogenes","Clostridiaceae, Pasteurellaceae"
22015987,Synthetic Escherichia coli consortia engineered for syntrophy demonstrate enhanced biomass productivity.,"Synthetic Escherichia coli consortia engineered for syntrophy demonstrated enhanced biomass productivity relative to monocultures. Binary consortia were designed to mimic a ubiquitous, naturally occurring ecological template of primary productivity supported by secondary consumption. The synthetic consortia replicated this evolution-proven strategy by combining a glucose positive E. coli strain, which served as the system's primary producer, with a glucose negative E. coli strain which consumed metabolic byproducts from the primary producer. The engineered consortia utilized strategic division of labor to simultaneously optimize multiple tasks enhancing overall culture performance. Consortial interactions resulted in the emergent property of enhanced system biomass productivity which was demonstrated with three distinct culturing systems: batch, chemostat and biofilm growth. Glucose-based biomass productivity increased by ∼15, 20 and 50% compared to appropriate monoculture controls for these three culturing systems, respectively. Interestingly, the consortial interactions also produced biofilms with predictable, self-assembling, laminated microstructures. This study establishes a metabolic engineering paradigm which can be easily adapted to existing E. coli based bioprocesses to improve productivity based on a robust ecological theme.",Journal of biotechnology,2012,3549274,10.1016/j.jbiotec.2011.10.001,1,Defined,Glucose,Biomass,Escherichia coli,Enterobacteriaceae
35538542,De novo biosynthesis of p-coumaric acid and caffeic acid from carboxymethyl-cellulose by microbial co-culture strategy.,"Aromatic compounds, such as p-coumaric acid (p-CA) and caffeic acid, are secondary metabolites of various plants, and are widely used in diet and industry for their biological activities. In addition to expensive and unsustainable methods of plant extraction and chemical synthesis, the strategy for heterologous synthesis of aromatic compounds in microorganisms has received much attention. As the most abundant renewable resource in the world, lignocellulose is an economical and environmentally friendly alternative to edible, high-cost carbon sources such as glucose.",Microbial cell factories,2022,9088102,10.1186/s12934-022-01805-5,1,Defined,Lignocellulose,"P-coumaric acid, Caffeic acid",Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Saccharomycetaceae
34370382,Adaptive laboratory evolution of microbial co-cultures for improved metabolite secretion.,"Adaptive laboratory evolution has proven highly effective for obtaining microorganisms with enhanced capabilities. Yet, this method is inherently restricted to the traits that are positively linked to cell fitness, such as nutrient utilization. Here, we introduce coevolution of obligatory mutualistic communities for improving secretion of fitness-costly metabolites through natural selection. In this strategy, metabolic cross-feeding connects secretion of the target metabolite, despite its cost to the secretor, to the survival and proliferation of the entire community. We thus co-evolved wild-type lactic acid bacteria and engineered auxotrophic Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a synthetic growth medium leading to bacterial isolates with enhanced secretion of two B-group vitamins, viz., riboflavin and folate. The increased production was specific to the targeted vitamin, and evident also in milk, a more complex nutrient environment that naturally contains vitamins. Genomic, proteomic and metabolomic analyses of the evolved lactic acid bacteria, in combination with flux balance analysis, showed altered metabolic regulation towards increased supply of the vitamin precursors. Together, our findings demonstrate how microbial metabolism adapts to mutualistic lifestyle through enhanced metabolite exchange.",Molecular systems biology,2021,8351387,10.15252/msb.202010189,1,Defined,Amino acid medium,Vitamins,"Lactobacillus plantarum, Saccharomyces cerevisiae","Saccharomycetaceae, Lactobacillaceae"

Each strain in pure culture produced only very little amount of polysaccharide from starch; the coexistence of the two strains from the early stage of cultivation was indispensable for a large amount of polysaccharide to be produced. The polysaccharide APK-78 was acidic and composed of glucose, galactose, succinic acid, and pyruvic acid with a molar ratio of 8.1:1.0:1.7:1.0, indicating that it is a succinoglycan type of polysaccharide.","Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry",2003,None,10.1271/bbb.67.8,1,Defined,Starch,Polysaccharide,"Cellulomonas cellulans, Agrobacterium tumefaciens","Promicromonosporaceae, Rhizobiaceae"
32863734,Metabolic modeling of bacterial co-culture systems predicts enhanced carbon monoxide-to-butyrate conversion compared to monoculture systems.,"We used metabolic modeling to computationally investigate the potential of bacterial coculture system designs for CO conversion to the platform chemical butyrate. By taking advantage of the native capabilities of wild-type strains, we developed two anaerobic coculture designs by combining <i>Clostridium autoethanogenum</i> for CO-to-acetate conversion with bacterial strains that offer high acetate-to-butyrate conversion capabilities: the environmental bacterium the human gut bacterium<i>Eubacterium rectale</i>. When grown in continuous stirred tank reactor on a 70/0/30 CO/H<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> gas mixture, the C. autoethanogenum-<i>C Kluyveri</i> co-culture was predicted to offer no mprovement in butyrate volumetric productivity compared to an engineered <i>C. autoethanogenum</i> monoculture despite utilizing vinyl acetate as a secondary carbon source for <i>C. kluyveri</i> growth enhancement. A coculture consisting of <i>C. autoethanogenum</i> and <i>C. kluyveri</i> engineered in silico to eliminate hexanoate synthesis was predicted to enhance both butyrate productivity and titer. The <i>C. autoethanogenum-E. rectale</i> coculture offered similar improvements in butyrate productivity without the need for metabolic engineering when glucose was provided as a secondary carbon source to enhance <i>E. rectale</i> growth. A bubble column model developed to assess the potential for large-scale butyrate production of the <i>C. autoethanogenum-E. rectale</i> design predicted that a 40/30/30 CO/H<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> gas mixture and a 5 m column length would be preferred to enhance <i>C. autoethanogenum</i> growth and counteract CO inhibitory effects on <i>E. rectale.</i>",Biochemical engineering journal,2019,7449128,10.1016/j.bej.2019.107338,1,Defined,CO,Butyrate,"Clostridium autoethanogenum, Eubacterium rectale, Clostridium kluyveri","Clostridiaceae, Eubacteriaceae"
25470793,Rationally engineered synthetic coculture for improved biomass and product formation.,"In microbial ecosystems, bacteria are dependent on dynamic interspecific interactions related to carbon and energy flow. Substrates and end-metabolites are rapidly converted to other compounds, which protects the community from high concentrations of inhibitory molecules. In biotechnological applications, pure cultures are preferred because of the more straight-forward metabolic engineering and bioprocess control. However, the accumulation of unwanted side products can limit the cell growth and process efficiency. In this study, a rationally engineered coculture with a carbon channeling system was constructed using two well-characterized model strains Escherichia coli K12 and Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1. The directed carbon flow resulted in efficient acetate removal, and the coculture showed symbiotic nature in terms of substrate utilization and growth. Recombinant protein production was used as a proof-of-principle example to demonstrate the coculture utility and the effects on product formation. As a result, the biomass and recombinant protein titers of E. coli were enhanced in both minimal and rich medium simple batch cocultures. Finally, harnessing both the strains to the production resulted in enhanced recombinant protein titers. The study demonstrates the potential of rationally engineered cocultures for synthetic biology applications.",PloS one,2014,4254613,10.1371/journal.pone.0113786,1,Defined,Glucose,Recombinant protein,"Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baylyi","Enterobacteriaceae, Moraxellaceae"
30390509,"Shaping microbial consortia in coupling glycerol fermentation and carboxylate chain elongation for Co-production of 1,3-propanediol and caproate: Pathways and mechanisms.","Glycerol is presently being generated in surplus with the rapid growth of the biodiesel industry and seeks ways to be upcycled, rather than to be treated with costs. Glycerol for the co-production of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) and caproate has a great prospect. Yet, its technical difficulty lies in the enhancement of caproate productivity, which requires the presence of ethanol as a co-substrate and necessitates the co-existence of functional microbes for glycerol fermentation and chain elongation. This study successfully achieved 6.38 mM C 1,3-PDO d<sup>-1</sup> and 2.95 mM C caproate d<sup>-1</sup> in a 2-L mixed-cultured semi-continuous fermenter with a glycerol-ethanol-acetate stoichiometric ratio of 4:3:1. Such conversions were mainly facilitated by a microbial community of Eubacterium limosum, Clostridium kluyveri and Massilibacterium senegalense. With such a synergistic microbiome, the co-production of 1,3-PDO and caproate was achieved from glycerol without ethanol addition. Based on metagenomics, E. limosum is capable of converting glycerol to 1,3-PDO, ethanol and H<sub>2</sub>, and also redirecting the electron potential of H<sub>2</sub> into acetate via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, which is then used for chain elongation. C. kluyveri worked synergistically with E. limosum by consuming ethanol and acetate for caproate production. M. senegalense encodes for ethanol oxidation to acetate and butyrate, facilitating the generation of these intermediates for C. kluyveri elongation to caproate. During the transition between fermentation and elongation, an unexpected observation of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) formation and reutilization by M. senegalense may be associated with butyrate formation for further caproate generation. The knowledge gleaned from the substrate constitute, microbial consortium and their synergetic metabolism demonstrates a resource upgrade potential for crude glycerol or glycerol-containing wastewater generated from the biodiesel industry.",Water research,2019,None,10.1016/j.watres.2018.10.063,1,Defined,Glycerol,"1,3-Propanediol, Caproate","Eubacterium limosum, Clostridium kluyveri, Massilibacterium senegalense","Clostridiaceae, Eubacteriaceae, Bacillaceae"
35730952,Engineering <i>Pseudomonas putida</i> To Produce Rhamnolipid Biosurfactants for Promoting Phenanthrene Biodegradation by a Two-Species Microbial Consortium.,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of organic contaminants that pose a significant environmental hazard. Phenanthrene is one of the model compounds for the study of biodegradation of PAHs. However, the biodegradation of phenanthrene is often limited by its low water solubility and dissolution rate. To overcome this limitation, we engineered a strain of Pseudomonas putida to produce rhamnolipid biosurfactants and thereby promote phenanthrene biodegradation by an engineered strain of Escherichia coli constructed previously in our lab. The E. coli-P. putida two-species consortium exhibited a synergistic effect of these two distinct organisms in degrading phenanthrene, resulting in an increase from 61.15 to 73.86% of the degradation ratio of 100 mg/L phenanthrene within 7 days. After additional optimization of the degradation conditions, the phenanthrene degradation ratio was improved to 85.73%. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are recalcitrant, carcinogenic, and tend to bioaccumulate, are widespread and persistent environmental pollutants. Based on these characteristics, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has listed PAHs as priority contaminants. Although there are many methods to treat PAH pollution, these methods are mostly limited by the poor water solubility of PAHs, which is especially true for the biodegradation process. Recent evidence of PAH-contaminated sites suffering from increasingly severe impact has emerged. As a result, the need to degrade PAHs is becoming urgent. The significance of our study lies in the development of nonpathogenic strains of biosurfactant-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa for promoting the degradation of phenanthrene by engineered Escherichia coli.",Microbiology spectrum,2022,9431653,10.1128/spectrum.00910-22,1,Defined,"Phenanthrene, Glycerol",Biosurfactants,"Pseudomonas putida, Escherichia coli","Pseudomonadaceae, Enterobacteriaceae"
36270363,Model-aided targeted volatile fatty acid production from food waste using a defined co-culture microbial community.,"The production of volatile fatty acids (VFA) is gaining momentum due to their central role in the emerging carboxylate platform. Particularly, the production of the longest VFA (from butyrate to caproate) is desired due to their increased economic value and easier downstream processing. While the use of undefined microbial cultures is usually preferred with organic waste streams, the use of defined microbial co-culture processes could tackle some of their drawbacks such as poor control over the process outcome, which often leads to low selectivity for the desired products. However, the extensive experimentation needed to design a co-culture system hinders the use of this technology. In this work, a workflow based on the combined use of mathematical models and wet experimentation is proposed to accelerate the design of novel bioprocesses. In particular, a co-culture consisting of Pediococcus pentosaceus and Megaphaera cerevisiae is used to target the production of high-value odd- and even‑carbon VFA. An unstructured kinetic model was developed, calibrated and used to design experiments with the goal of increasing the selectivity for the desired VFA, which were experimentally validated. In the case of even‑carbon VFA, the experimental validation showed an increase of 38 % in caproate yield and, in the case of enhanced odd‑carbon VFA experiments, the yield of butyrate and caproate diminished by 62 % and 94 %, respectively, while propionate became one of the main end products and valerate yield value increased from 0.007 to 0.085 g<sub>valearte</sub> per g<sub>consumed sugar.</sub> The workflow followed in this work proved to be a sound tool for bioprocess design due to its capacity to explore and design new experiments in silico in a fast way and ability to quickly adapt to new scenarios.",The Science of the total environment,2023,None,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159521,1,Defined,Food waste,VFA,"Pediococcus pentosaceus, Megasphaera cerevisiae","Lactobacillaceae, Veillonellaceae"
36243085,Mutualistic microbial community of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and recombinant Yarrowia lipolytica co-produced lipopeptides and fatty acids from food waste.,"Bioconversion is an important method for transforming food waste (FW) into high value-added products, rendering it harmless, and recycling resources. An artificial microbial consortium (AMC) was constructed to produce FW-based lipopeptides in order to investigate the strategy of FW bioconversion into value-added products. Exogenous fatty acids as a precursor significantly improved the lipopeptide production of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens HM618. To enhance fatty acid synthesis and efflux in AMC, the recombinant Yarrowia lipolytica YL21 (strain YL21) was constructed by screening 12 target genes related to fatty acids to replace exogenous fatty acids in order to improve lipopeptide production. The levels of fengycin, surfactin, and iturin A in the AMC of strains HM618 and YL21 reached 76.19, 192.80, and 31.32 mg L<sup>-1</sup>, increasing 7.24-, 12.13-, and 3.23-fold compared to the results from the pure culture of strain HM618 in flask with Landy medium, respectively. Furthermore, free fatty acids were almost undetectable in the co-culture of strains HM618 and YL21, although its level was around 1.25 g L<sup>-1</sup> in the pure culture of strain YL21 with Landy medium. Interestingly, 470.24 mg L<sup>-1</sup> of lipopeptides and 18.11 g L<sup>-1</sup> of fatty acids were co-produced in this AMC in a bioreactor with FW medium. To our knowledge, it is the first report of FW biotransformation into co-produce of lipopeptides and fatty acids in the AMC of B. amyloliquefaciens and Y. lipolytica.

29486411,Engineering of artificial microbial consortia of Ralstonia eutropha and Bacillus subtilis for poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) copolymer production from sugarcane sugar without precursor feeding.,"Ralstonia eutropha is a well-known microbe reported for polyhydroxyalkonate (PHA) production, and unable to utilize sucrose as carbon source. Two strains, Ralstonia eutropha H16 and Ralstonia eutropha 5119 were co-cultured with sucrose hydrolyzing microbes (Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens) for PHA production. Co-culture of B. subtilis:R. eutropha 5119 (BS:RE5) resulted in best PHA production (45% w/w dcw). Optimization of the PHA production process components through response surface resulted in sucrose: NH<sub>4</sub>Cl:B. subtilis: R. eutropha (3.0:0.17:0.10:0.190). Along with the hydrolysis of sucrose, B. subtilis also ferments sugars into organic acid (propionic acid), which acts as a precursor for HV monomer unit. Microbial consortia of BS:RE5 when cultured in optimized media led to the production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (P(3HB-co-3HV) with 66% w/w of dcw having 16 mol% HV fraction.

The concentration of HA secreted by L. lactis was controlled through adjusting the constant feed rate of glucose. The dynamic growth of the strains revealed that L. lactis was mainly growing within 48 h while G. hansenii started to grow after 48 h. XRD analysis indicated the presence of HA would not affect the crystallinity of cellulose but increase the crystalline sizes. The FESEM images showed that more ribbons within the width of 20-40 nm and larger ribbons between 180 and 360 nm were observed in BC/HA.

However, because of low efficiency of total chemical synthesis and low yield of current microbial fermentation, the limited production restricts its broad applications. Thus, the strategies to improve the production of cercosporin were highly desired. Besides traditional optimization methods, here we screened leaf-spot-disease-related endophytic bacteria to co-culture with our previous identified Cercospora sp.

29314110,Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) production in bacterial co-culture using glucose and volatile fatty acids as carbon source.,"Mixed bacterial cultures are increasingly being used in the production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), as they have the potential to be more cost effective than axenic pure cultures. The purpose of this study was to use pure cultures in combination to identify their potential of PHA production. In this work we used volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and glucose as carbon source to check the ability of selected strains ST2 (Pseudomonas sp.) and CS8 (Bacillus sp.) as co-culture. The production of PHA in pure co-cultures of bacteria was therefore investigated in order to understand the effect of combining cultures on PHA production parameters and material properties. Bacteria could use the feed in better way when mixed as compared to individual strain. In undertaking this analysis, model volatile fatty acids (i.e., acetic and propionic acids) were used alone and in combination with glucose as feedstock. The production by Pseudomonas was 34% while 24% by Bacillus. However when combined and mixed feed (glucose + propionic acid) was used, 35% PHA produced. Overall, it was found that the ability of the pure cultures to produce PHA was low but when selected cultures were mixed, their ability to produce PHA was enhanced. Copolymers were obtained instead of homopolymers with improved properties. This suggests that industrial wastewater rich in volatile fatty acids and carbohydrates can be a good carbon source for PHA production with variable properties.",Journal of basic microbiology,2018,None,10.1002/jobm.201700276,1,Defined,"Glucose, VFA_s",Polyhydroxyalkanoate,"Pseudomonas sp, Bacillus subtilis","Bacillaceae, Pseudomonas"
28039824,Design and composition of synthetic fungal-bacterial microbial consortia that improve lignocellulolytic enzyme activity.,"Microbial interactions are important for metabolism as they can improve or reduce metabolic efficiency. To improve lignocellulolytic enzyme activity, a series of synergistic microbial consortia of increasing diversity and complexity were devised using fungal strains, including Trichoderma reesei, Penicillium decumbens, Aspergillus tubingensis, and Aspergillus niger. However, when a screened microbial community with cellulolytic capacity was added to the consortia to increase the number of strains, it engendered more microbial interactions with the above strains and universally improved the β-glucosidase activity of the consortia. Analysis of the microbial community structure revealed that the bacteria in the consortia are more important for lignocellulolytic enzyme activity than the fungi. One fungal and 16 bacterial genera in the consortia may interact with T. reesei and are potential members of a devised synergistic microbial consortium.

32946127,Consolidated bioprocessing performance of a two-species microbial consortium for butanol production from lignocellulosic biomass.,"Consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) by using microbial consortium was considered as a promising approach to achieve direct biofuel production from lignocellulose. In this study, the interaction mechanism of microbial consortium consisting of Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum M5 and Clostridium acetobutylicum NJ4 was analyzed, which could achieve efficient butanol production from xylan through CBP. Strain M5 possesses efficient xylan degradation capability, as 19.73 g/L of xylose was accumulated within 50 hr. The efficient xylose utilization capability of partner strain NJ4 could relieve the substrate inhibition to hydrolytic enzymes of xylanase and xylosidase secreted by strain M5. In addition, the earlier solventogenesis of strain NJ4 was observed due to the existence of butyrate generated by strain M5. The mutual interaction of these two strains finally gave 13.28 g/L of butanol from 70 g/L of xylan after process optimization, representing a relatively high butanol production from hemicellulose. Moreover, 7.61 g/L of butanol was generated from untreated corncob via CBP. This successfully constructed microbial consortium exhibits efficient cooperation performance on butanol production from lignocellulose, which could provide a platform for the emerging butanol production from lignocellulose.",Biotechnology and bioengineering,2020,None,10.1002/bit.27464,1,Defined,Lignocellulose,Butanol,"Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum, Clostridium acetobutylicum","Thermoanaerobacterales, Clostridiaceae"

For this reason, three strains belonging to <i>Bacillus</i> genus, namely, <i>Aeribacillus pallidus</i> VP3, <i>Lysinibacillus fusiformis</i> C250R, and <i>Anoxybacillus kamchatkensis</i> M1V were studied under co-culture procedure. A Taguchi L27 experimental design was applied to optimize the co-culture parameters. The experimental design was built with 9 factors (by-product powder concentration, the pH of the medium, the temperature, the sucrose concentration, the agitation speed, the inoculum sizes of VP3, M1V, and C250R strains, and the culture volume) at three different levels. The obtained results showed that a total protease activity of 8,182 U/mL could be achieved after 24 h of incubation in presence of 20 g/L shrimp by-product and 10 g/L sucrose, at an initial pH of 7, a 40°C temperature and absorbance, at 600 nm, of inoculum sizes of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.1 for VP3, M1V, and C250R strains, respectively. The agitation was set at 200 rpm, and the final volume was 25 mL. Taguchi's design allowed the identification of temperature, the inoculum size for strain VP3, the inoculum size for strain M1V, and the final culture volume as the most influencing variables. A Box-Behnken design with 27 experiments was carried out for the optimization of these four selected factors. Following such design, the highest protease production reached was 11,300 U/mL. This yield was obtained in a final culture volume of 15 mL containing 20 g/L shrimp by-product powder and 10 g/L sucrose and inoculated with VP3, C250R, and M1V strains at 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2, respectively. The flasks were incubated at 45°C for 24 h with shaking at 200 rpm. The efficiency of chitin extraction by co-cultivation was investigated under the latter conditions.

Acetate and ethanol are main products of syngas fermentation by acetogens. Therefore, syngas can be indirectly used as a substrate for the chain elongation process.",Biotechnology for biofuels,2016,4818930,10.1186/s13068-016-0495-0,1,Defined,"CO, Syngas",MCFA,"Clostridium autoethanogenum, Clostridium kluyveri",Clostridiaceae
33990298,Propionate Production from Carbon Monoxide by Synthetic Cocultures of Acetobacterium wieringae and Propionigenic Bacteria.,"Gas fermentation is a promising way to convert CO-rich gases to chemicals. We studied the use of synthetic cocultures composed of carboxydotrophic and propionigenic bacteria to convert CO to propionate. So far, isolated carboxydotrophs cannot directly ferment CO to propionate, and therefore, this cocultivation approach was investigated. Four distinct synthetic cocultures were constructed, consisting of Acetobacterium wieringae (DSM 1911<sup>T</sup>) and Pelobacter propionicus (DSM 2379<sup>T</sup>), <i>Ac. wieringae</i> (DSM 1911<sup>T</sup>) and Anaerotignum neopropionicum (DSM 3847<sup>T</sup>), <i>Ac. wieringae</i> strain JM and <i>P. propionicus</i> (DSM 2379<sup>T</sup>), and <i>Ac. wieringae</i> strain JM and <i>An. neopropionicum</i> (DSM 3847<sup>T</sup>). Propionate was produced by all the cocultures, with the highest titer (∼24 mM) being measured in the coculture composed of <i>Ac. wieringae</i> strain JM and <i>An. neopropionicum</i>, which also produced isovalerate (∼4 mM), butyrate (∼1 mM), and isobutyrate (0.3 mM). This coculture was further studied using proteogenomics. As expected, enzymes involved in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway in <i>Ac. wieringae</i> strain JM, which are responsible for the conversion of CO to ethanol and acetate, were detected; the proteome of <i>An. neopropionicum</i> confirmed the conversion of ethanol to propionate via the acrylate pathway. In addition, proteins related to amino acid metabolism and stress response were highly abundant during cocultivation, which raises the hypothesis that amino acids are exchanged by the two microorganisms, accompanied by isovalerate and isobutyrate production. This highlights the importance of explicitly looking at fortuitous microbial interactions during cocultivation to fully understand coculture behavior. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Syngas fermentation has great potential for the sustainable production of chemicals from wastes (via prior gasification) and flue gases containing CO/CO<sub>2</sub>. Research efforts need to be directed toward expanding the product portfolio of gas fermentation, which is currently limited to mainly acetate and ethanol. This study provides the basis for a microbial process to produce propionate from CO using synthetic cocultures composed of acetogenic and propionigenic bacteria and elucidates the metabolic pathways involved. Furthermore, based on proteomics results, we hypothesize that the two bacterial species engage in an interaction that results in amino acid exchange, which subsequently promotes isovalerate and isobutyrate production. These findings provide a new understanding of gas fermentation and a coculturing strategy for expanding the product spectrum of microbial conversion of CO/CO<sub>2</sub>.",Applied and environmental microbiology,2021,8231444,10.1128/AEM.02839-20,1,Defined,"CO, Syngas",Propionate,"Acetobacterium wieringae, Pelobacter propionicus, Anaerotignum neopropionicum","Eubacteriaceae, Desulfuromonadaceae, Lachnospiraceae"
28429329,Hydrogen production and microbial kinetics of Clostridium termitidis in mono-culture and co-culture with Clostridium beijerinckii on cellulose.,"Cellulose utilization by hydrogen producers remains an issue due to the low hydrogen yields reported and the pretreatment of cellulose prior to fermentation requires complex and expensive steps. Clostridium termitidis is able to breakdown cellulose into glucose and produce hydrogen. On the other hand, Clostridium beijerinckii is not able to degrade cellulose but is adept at hydrogen production from glucose; therefore, it was chosen to potentially enhance hydrogen production when co-cultured with C. termitidis on cellulose. In this study, batch fermentation tests were conducted to investigate the direct hydrogen production enhancement of mesophilic cellulolytic bacteria C. termitidis co-cultured with mesophilic hydrogen producer C. beijerinckii on cellulose at 2 g l<sup>-1</sup> compared to C. termitidis mono-culture. Microbial kinetics parameters were determined by modeling in MATLAB. The achieved highest hydrogen yield was 1.92 mol hydrogen mol<sup>-1</sup> hexose equivalent<sub>added</sub> in the co-culture compared to 1.45 mol hydrogen mol<sup>-1</sup> hexose equivalent<sub>added</sub> in the mono-culture. The maximum hydrogen production rate of 26 ml d<sup>-1</sup> was achieved in the co-culture. Co-culture exhibited an overall 32 % enhancement of hydrogen yield based on hexose equivalent added and 15 % more substrate utilization. The main metabolites were acetate, ethanol, lactate, and formate in the mono-culture, with also butyrate in the co-culture. Additionally, the hydrogen yield of C. beijerinckii only in glucose was 2.54 mol hydrogen mol<sup>-1</sup> hexose equivalent. This study has proved the viability of co-culture of C. termitidis with C. beijerinckii for hydrogen production directly from a complex substrate like cellulose under mesophilic conditions.",AMB Express,2017,5399015,10.1186/s13568-016-0256-2,1,Defined,Cellulose,Hydrogen,"Clostridium termitidis, Clostridium beijerinckii",Clostridiaceae

Furthermore, whole-cell immobilization was performed using magnetic nanoparticle (MNP)-loaded polymers to develop an efficient bioprocess. The anaerobic digestion of WS by cattle dung yielded 219 L/kg of total solids reduced. Methanol produced was 5.08 and 6.39 mmol/L by pure- and co-cultures from biogas, respectively.

23959872,Design and characterization of synthetic fungal-bacterial consortia for direct production of isobutanol from cellulosic biomass.,"Synergistic microbial communities are ubiquitous in nature and exhibit appealing features, such as sophisticated metabolic capabilities and robustness. This has inspired fast-growing interest in engineering synthetic microbial consortia for biotechnology development. However, there are relatively few reports of their use in real-world applications, and achieving population stability and regulation has proven to be challenging. In this work, we bridge ecology theory with engineering principles to develop robust synthetic fungal-bacterial consortia for efficient biosynthesis of valuable products from lignocellulosic feedstocks. The required biological functions are divided between two specialists: the fungus Trichoderma reesei, which secretes cellulase enzymes to hydrolyze lignocellulosic biomass into soluble saccharides, and the bacterium Escherichia coli, which metabolizes soluble saccharides into desired products. We developed and experimentally validated a comprehensive mathematical model for T. reesei/E. coli consortia, providing insights on key determinants of the system's performance. To illustrate the bioprocessing potential of this consortium, we demonstrate direct conversion of microcrystalline cellulose and pretreated corn stover to isobutanol. Without costly nutrient supplementation, we achieved titers up to 1.88 g/L and yields up to 62% of theoretical maximum. In addition, we show that cooperator-cheater dynamics within T. reesei/E. coli consortia lead to stable population equilibria and provide a mechanism for tuning composition. Although we offer isobutanol production as a proof-of-concept application, our modular system could be readily adapted for production of many other valuable biochemicals.

However, bispecific-antibody design and production remain challenging, owing to the need to incorporate two distinct heavy and light chain pairs while maintaining natural nonimmunogenic antibody architecture. Here we present a bispecific-antibody production strategy that relies on co-culture of two bacterial strains, each expressing a half-antibody. Using this approach, we produce 28 unique bispecific antibodies. A bispecific antibody against the receptor tyrosine kinases MET and EGFR binds both targets monovalently, inhibits their signaling, and suppresses MET and EGFR-driven cell and tumor growth. Our strategy allows rapid generation of bispecific antibodies from any two existing antibodies and yields milligram to gram quantities of bispecific antibodies sufficient for a wide range of discovery and preclinical applications.

Uptake of cathodic electrons is particularly important in microbial electrosynthesis of sustainable fuel and chemical precursors using only CO<sub>2</sub> and electricity as carbon, electron and energy source. Typically, large overpotentials (200 to 400 mV) were reported to be required for cathodic electron uptake during electrosynthesis of, for example, methane and acetate, or low electrosynthesis rates were observed. To address these limitations and to explore conceptual alternatives, we studied defined co-cultures metabolizing cathodic electrons. The Fe(0)-corroding strain IS4 was used to catalyze the electron uptake reaction from the cathode forming molecular hydrogen as intermediate, and Methanococcus maripaludis and Acetobacterium woodii were used as model microorganisms for hydrogenotrophic synthesis of methane and acetate, respectively.

This study investigated the influence of organic load rates (OLRs) on short-chain carboxylic acids (SCCAs) production and microbial communities for co-digestion of swine manure (SM) and corn silage (CS) during four different OLRs stages in a semi-continuous mode. The results showed that relatively stable SCCAs concentration of 10.5-13.6 g COD/L and SCCAs yield of 0.42 mg COD/mg VS was achieved at OLR of 3.0 g VS/L·d. The maximum concentration of 19.1 g COD/L was achieved at 3.5 g VS/L·d. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) (include acetic, n-butyric and caproic acids) accounted for approximately 80% of SCCAs. Hydrolysis bacteria (HB) including Clostridium, Terriporobacter, Intestinibacter, and Turiibacter decreased with the increase of OLR, while acidogenic bacteria (AB) including Acetobacter, Lactobacillus, Aeriscardovia, and Pseudomonas increased, resulting in insufficient degradation of CS.",Bioresource technology,2021,None,10.1016/j.biortech.2020.124400,1,Undefined,"Manure compost, Lignocellulose",SCCA,,Undefined

Although the activated sludge process could treat the PO saponification wastewater effectively, the residual sludge was difficult to be disposed properly. In this research, microbes in PO saponification wastewater residual sludge were acclimated to produce poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) from volatile fatty acids. Through Miseq Illumina highthroughput sequencing, the bacterial community discrepancy between the original and the acclimated sludge samples were analyzed. The proportions of Bacillus, Acinetobacter, Brevundimonas and Pseudomonas, the potential PHBV-producers in the residual sludge, were all obviously increased. In the batch fermentation, the production of PHBV could achieve 4.262g/L at 300min, with the content increased from 0.04% to 23.67% of mixed liquor suspended solid (MLSS) in the acclimated sludge, and the COD of the PO saponification wastewater was also decreased in the fermentation.

34619589,Bioelectricity production and shortcut nitrogen removal by microalgal-bacterial consortia using membrane photosynthetic microbial fuel cell.,"Membrane photosynthetic microbial fuel cell (MPMFC) utilizes O<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> as cathodic electron acceptors, enabling simultaneous treatment of nitrogen, CO<sub>2</sub> and organic carbon in the cathode compartment. In this work, development of a novel cathodic process with in situ nitritation via microalgal photosynthesis during the light period is reported for achieving shortcut nitrogen removal (SNR) from ammonium-rich wastewater. Moreover, a tubular low-cost ceramic membrane was used to separate and recycle the microalgal-bacterial biomass to the cathode compartment during the continuous operation. The influence of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentration and ratio of chemical oxygen demand to total nitrogen on the MPMFC performance was examined. Denitritation under dark and anoxic conditions occurred due to denitrifying bacteria (DNB) subsequent to nitritation under light and aerobic conditions by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in the consortia. Final concentrations of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> in the effluent of 0.10 mg NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-L<sup>-1</sup> and 0.02 mg NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>-L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, were obtained using MPMFC which resulted in a nitrogen removal efficiency of 99 ± 0.5%. The maximum electricity production achieved using the MPMFC was 56 ± 0.1 mA. This study demonstrated that combining microalgal photosynthesis, nitritation and denitritation in the cathode compartment of MPMFC is advantageous for avoiding the cost due to external aeration and organic carbon source necessary for ammonium removal as well as utilization of NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> or NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> as an electron acceptor.",Journal of environmental management,2022,None,10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113871,1,Undefined,Wastewater sludge,Electricity,,Undefined
20854983,Potent antilisterial cell-free supernatants produced by complex red-smear cheese microbial consortia.,"The microbial surface ripening consortia of 49 soft cheeses were investigated with respect to their inhibition of Listeria monocytogenes. When L. monocytogenes EGDe (serovar 1/2a) was cultivated in cell-free supernatants obtained from consortia grown for 8 h in liquid medium, a strong bactericidal activity was observed in several cases. The cell-free supernatants of 2 of these consortia (I and II) reduced an initial L. monocytogenes inoculum of 5 × 10(7) cfu/mL to zero after 24 h of incubation. No inhibitory substances could be washed off the complex consortia when incubated for a 10-min period. A taxonomical analysis of the antilisterial consortia I and II using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy yielded a considerable species diversity, with lactic acid bacteria increasing strongly during the 8-h cultivation. Therefore, 23 lactic acid bacteria bacteriocin genes were assayed using specific PCR primers, identifying 3 bacteriocin genes in both microbial communities. However, no transcription of these genes was found on cheese surfaces or in consortia propagated in liquid culture. Individual lactic acid bacteria isolates of consortia I and II displayed no or only weak inhibition of L. monocytogenes on solid medium. The complex cell-free supernatants I and II, in contrast, exhibited an unusually broad inhibitory spectrum, killing L. monocytogenes ssp., Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, as well as gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli DH5α and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Inhibition could not be abolished by heating to 100°C or by proteinase K treatment. Initial purification of an inhibitory substance from consortium I by solid-phase extraction and HPLC indicates the presence of rather small, extremely stable compounds, which, most probably, are not bacteriocins.",Journal of dairy science,2010,None,10.3168/jds.2010-3244,1,Undefined,Glycerol,Antilisterial compounds,,Undefined

Poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) was produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens C1 in SSF using dairy manure compost and monosodium glutamate production residuals as basic substrates. The production of γ-PGA reached a maximum of 0.6% after 20 days fermentation. Real-time polymerase chain reaction showed the amount of total bacteria reached 3.95 × 10(9) 16S rDNA copies/g sample after 30 days, which was in good accordance with the 4.80 × 10(9) CFU/g obtained by plate counting. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profile showed a reduction of microbial diversity during fermentation, while the inoculum, B. amyloliquefaciens C1, was detected as the dominant organism through the whole process. In the mesophilic phase of SSF, Proteobacteria was the dominant microbial, which was replaced by Firmicutes and Actinobacteria in the thermophilic phase. The molecular analysis of the bacterial diversity has significant potential for instructing the maturing process of SSF to produce γ-PGA at a large-scale level, which could be a benefit in the production of high quality and stable SSF products.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2011,None,10.1007/s00253-011-3375-3,1,Undefined,Manure compost,Glutamic acid,,Undefined
25904907,Biosurfactant production from marine hydrocarbon-degrading consortia and pure bacterial strains using crude oil as carbon source.,"Biosurfactants (BSs) are ""green"" amphiphilic molecules produced by microorganisms during biodegradation, increasing the bioavailability of organic pollutants. In this work, the BS production yield of marine hydrocarbon degraders isolated from Elefsina bay in Eastern Mediterranean Sea has been investigated. The drop collapse test was used as a preliminary screening test to confirm BS producing strains or mixed consortia. The community structure of the best consortia based on the drop collapse test was determined by 16S-rDNA pyrotag screening. Subsequently, the effect of incubation time, temperature, substrate and supplementation with inorganic nutrients, on BS production, was examined. Two types of BS - lipid mixtures were extracted from the culture broth; the low molecular weight BS Rhamnolipids and Sophorolipids. Crude extracts were purified by silica gel column chromatography and then identified by thin layer chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Results indicate that BS production yield remains constant and low while it is independent of the total culture biomass, carbon source, and temperature. A constant BS concentration in a culture broth with continuous degradation of crude oil (CO) implies that the BS producing microbes generate no more than the required amount of BSs that enables biodegradation of the CO. Isolated pure strains were found to have higher specific production yields than the complex microbial marine community-consortia. The heavy oil fraction of CO has emerged as a promising substrate for BS production (by marine BS producers) with fewer impurities in the final product. Furthermore, a particular strain isolated from sediments, Paracoccus marcusii, may be an optimal choice for bioremediation purposes as its biomass remains trapped in the hydrocarbon phase, not suffering from potential dilution effects by sea currents.",Frontiers in microbiology,2015,4387541,10.3389/fmicb.2015.00274,1,Undefined,Crude oil,Biosurfactants,,Undefined
24562979,Biohydrogen production through dark fermentation by a microbial consortium using whey permeate as substrate.,"Nowadays, hydrogen produced globally has been synthesized from fossil fuel with limited source. Therefore, research has been developed in order to explore biological H2 production by dark fermentation. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the effect of initial pH and ferrous sulfate and ammonium sulfate concentrations on the production of biohydrogen by dark fermentation. The process was carried out in batch mode under anaerobic conditions, in the absence of light, and at standard room temperature and pressure. A microbial consortium provided by the effluent treatment plant of a local dairy company was inoculated into a synthetic medium supplemented with cheese whey permeate (20 g/L of lactose) as a carbon source. The influence of three variables was analyzed by a central composite design 2((3)), and the optimum results of hydrogen yield (4.13 mol H2/mol lactose) and productivity (86.31 mmol H2/L/day) were achieved at initial pH 7.0 and FeSO4 and (NH4)2SO4 concentrations of 0.6 and 1.5 g/L, respectively. Under these conditions, the kinetic parameters of fermentation were investigated by analyzing the profile of H2 yield and productivity, metabolite concentrations, pH, and concentration of dissolved iron. In the kinetic analysis, the modified Gompertz equation described adequately the fermentative hydrogen production from cheese whey permeate (R (2) = 0.98). The profile of ethanol and volatile organic acids showed that lactic acid and butyric acid were the main metabolites produced, and the sum of both by-products corresponded to about 58 % of the total metabolites.",Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,2014,None,10.1007/s12010-014-0778-5,1,Undefined,Food waste,Hydrogen,,Undefined
24829563,Conversion of crude oil to methane by a microbial consortium enriched from oil reservoir production waters.,"The methanogenic biodegradation of crude oil is an important process occurring in petroleum reservoirs and other oil-containing environments such as contaminated aquifers. In this process, syntrophic bacteria degrade hydrocarbon substrates to products such as acetate, and/or H2 and CO2 that are then used by methanogens to produce methane in a thermodynamically dependent manner. We enriched a methanogenic crude oil-degrading consortium from production waters sampled from a low temperature heavy oil reservoir. Alkylsuccinates indicative of fumarate addition to C5 and C6 n-alkanes were identified in the culture (above levels found in controls), corresponding to the detection of an alkyl succinate synthase encoding gene (assA/masA) in the culture. In addition, the enrichment culture was tested for its ability to produce methane from residual oil in a sandstone-packed column system simulating a mature field. Methane production rates of up to 5.8 μmol CH4/g of oil/day were measured in the column system. Amounts of produced methane were in relatively good agreement with hydrocarbon loss showing depletion of more than 50% of saturate and aromatic hydrocarbons. Microbial community analysis revealed that the enrichment culture was dominated by members of the genus Smithella, Methanosaeta, and Methanoculleus. However, a shift in microbial community occurred following incubation of the enrichment in the sandstone columns. Here, Methanobacterium sp. were most abundant, as were bacterial members of the genus Pseudomonas and other known biofilm forming organisms. Our findings show that microorganisms enriched from petroleum reservoir waters can bioconvert crude oil components to methane both planktonically and in sandstone-packed columns as test systems. Further, the results suggest that different organisms may contribute to oil biodegradation within different phases (e.g., planktonic vs. sessile) within a subsurface crude oil reservoir.",Frontiers in microbiology,2014,4017130,10.3389/fmicb.2014.00197,1,Undefined,Crude oil,Methane,,Undefined

The performance of the MFCs was enhanced to produce a stable power of 140mWm(-2) and a maximum power density of 235mWm(-2) by increasing pH to 11.0. This is the highest pH for stably operating MFCs reported in the literature. Power production was found to be suppressed at higher pH (12.0) and lower pH (9.0).

We have used acetate-fed MFCs inoculated with sediment, with two-chamber bottles and carbon cloth electrodes to deliver a maximum power output of ~175 mW · m(-2) and a stable power output of ~105 mW · m(-2). Power production was by direct transfer of electrons to the anode from bacterial consortia growing on the anode, as confirmed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Twenty different species (74 strains) of bacteria were isolated from the consortium under anaerobic conditions and cultured in the laboratory, of which 34% were found to be exoelectrogens in single-species studies. Exoelectrogenesis by members of the genera Vibrio , Enterobacter , and Citrobacter and by Bacillus stratosphericus was confirmed, by use of culture-based methods, for the first time. An MFC with a natural bacterial consortium showed higher power densities than those obtained with single strains. In addition, the maximum power output could be further increased to ~200 mW · m(-2) when an artificial consortium consisting of the best 25 exoelectrogenic isolates was used, demonstrating the potential for increased performance and underlying the importance of artificial biofilms for increasing power output.",Environmental science & technology,2012,None,10.1021/es2020007,1,Undefined,Acetate,Electricity,,Undefined

36493824,Using heat-activated persulfate to accelerate short-chain fatty acids production from waste activated sludge fermentation triggered by sulfate-reducing microbial consortium.,"Persulfate has been applied extensively for waste activated sludge (WAS) decomposition due to the strong oxidizing sulfate radical generated as a product. However, the efficiency is not improved without activation to produce free radicals. In this study, a novel coupling strategy of heat-activated persulfate (Heat_PS) pretreatment and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) triggering was explored to enhance short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by WAS fermentation. The remaining sulfate acts as an essential acceptor of electrons for the metabolism of synergistic SRB, thereby boosting WAS acidification by energetic cooperation with anaerobic fermenters. The results showed that SCFAs yield in the Heat_PS + SRB group peaked at 431.89 mg COD/gVSS, with the proportion of acetate reaching 57.8 %. This was 6.33 and 1.75 times higher than that in raw and single Heat_PS treated WAS, respectively. Carbon balance revealed a conversion rate of 26.1 % of carbon content in WAS to SCFAs, with 4.5 % lower CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents emitted than that in raw WAS fermentation by the assessments of environmental impacts. This was partially attributed to the strong decomposition of WAS by SO<sub>4</sub><sup>•-</sup> and <sup>•</sup>OH oxidation from heat-activated PS and the SRB trigger.

In this study, the selection of microbial consortia by enrichment on hydrolysate of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>-pretreated corn stover (pre-CS) without detoxification has been investigated as an efficient way to develop new strategies for lignocellulose utilization. The analysis of cattle stomach-dervied microbial consortia domesticated to degrade hydrolysate of pre-CS to produce lactic acid (LA) at different temperatures was investigated. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing analyses indicated that the three microbial consortia were taxonomically distinct and Enterococcus became dominant at high temperature. The highest glucose consumption rate was observed at 45 °C, while the three microbial consortia showed similar consumption rates of xylose and arabinose.

In this study, barley straw and hay co-substrate was pretreated with a microaerobic barley straw-adapted microbial (BSAM) consortium prior to anaerobic digestion. The improved digestibility was investigated through 16S rRNA gene sequencing, microbial counts and C:N ratios. BSAM pretreatment resulted in 15.2 L kg<sup>-1</sup> TS of methane yield after 35 days, almost 40 times more than the control. The methane content in total biogas produced were 58% (v/v) and 10% (v/v) in BSAM and control, respectively. This research demonstrated that BSAM-based pretreatment significantly increased the digestibility and surface area of the lignocellulosic material and considerably enhanced biomethanation.

These poorly crystalline nanoparticles with an average size of 29.97 ± 7.1 nm, comprising of FeS and FeS<sub>2</sub>, significantly promoted extracellular electron transfer and thus the electricity generation of the MFC. A maximum power density of 519.00 mW/m<sup>2</sup> was obtained from the MFC, which was 1.92 times as high as that of the control. The cell viability was promoted by a small amount of iron sulfide nanoparticles but inhibited by the thick nanoparticle ""shell"" covered on the bacterial cells.

30834245,"Bioconversion of Raw Glycerol From Waste Cooking-Oil-Based Biodiesel Production to 1,3-Propanediol and Lactate by a Microbial Consortium.","Waste cooking oil (WCO) is a sustainable alternative to raw vegetable oils and fats for biodiesel production considering both environmental and economic benefits. Raw glycerol from WCO-based biodiesel production (GWCO) is difficult to utilize via biological method, as multiple toxic impurities have inhibitory effects on microbial growth especially for pure cultures. In this work, four microbial consortia were selected from activated sludge by 30 serial transfers under different conditions. The obtained consortia exhibited lower diversity and species difference with the transfers. The consortium LS30 exhibited unique advantages for bioconversion of GWCO to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) and lactate (LA). Moreover, the fermentation could be performed economically under microaerobic and non-sterile conditions. The consortium consisted of 57.97% <i>Enterobacter</i> and 39.25% <i>Escherichia</i> could effectively convert 60 g/L GWCO to 1,3-PDO and LA in batch fermentation. In addition, this consortium exhibited better tolerance to fatty acid-derived crude glycerol (100 g/L), which demonstrated that specific toxic impurities in GWCO did pose a great challenge to microbial growth and metabolism. In fed batch fermentation, 27.77 g/L 1,3-PDO and 14.68 g/L LA were achieved. Compared with the consortium, a long lag phase in cell growth associated with a decreased glycerol consumption was observed in four single-strain fermentations. Furthermore, neither the consortium DL38 with excellent glycerol tolerance nor consortium C2-2M with high yield of 1,3-PDO could effectively transform GWCO into valuable products. The results demonstrated that the selected microbial consortium has the advanced adaptability to the toxic impurities in GWCO compared with other reported consortia and isolated single strain. This process can contribute to added-value use of GWCO.",Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,2019,6387908,10.3389/fbioe.2019.00014,1,Undefined,Glycerol,"1,3-Propanediol, Lactate",,Undefined

MM1 was composed of strain BAFRT4 identified as Staphylococcus sp. and strain CYGS1 identified as Pseudomonas sp. The flocculating activity of MMF1 isolated from the screening medium was 82.9%, which is remarkably higher than that of the bioflocculant produced by either of the strains under the same condition. Brewery wastewater was also used as the carbon source for MM1, and the cost-effective production medium for MM1 mainly comprised 1.0 L brewery water (chemical oxygen demand (COD) 5000 mg/L), 0.5 g/L urea, 0.5 g/L yeast extract, and 0.2 g/L (NH4)2SO4. The optimal conditions for the production of MMF1 was inoculum size 2%, initial pH 6.0, cultivating temperature 30 degrees C, and shaking speed 160 r/min, under which the flocculating activity of the MMF1 reached 96.8%. Fifteen grams of purified bioflocculant could be recovered from 1.0 L of fermentation broth. MMF1 was identified as a macromolecular substance containing both protein and polysaccharide.

30420331,Enriched microbial consortia for dark fermentation of sugarcane vinasse towards value-added short-chain organic acids and alcohol production.,"The role of sugarcane vinasse as a nutrient source and the impacts of different inoculum pretreatment methods (acid-thermal and thermal treatment) were assessed in acidogenic systems aiming to produce value-added short-chain organic acids (SCOA) and alcohols. In-depth microbiome characterization was also conducted by high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene using the Miseq Illumina platform. SCOA production was 47.3 % higher in vinasse-fed reactors, with isobutyric (up to 10.3 g L<sup>-1</sup>) and butyric (up to 10.6 g L<sup>-1</sup>) acids as the primary metabolites most likely resulting from lactate conversion. Ethanol comprised the main product from solventogenic pathways in all conditions, with values ranging between 2.7 and 5.2 g L<sup>-1</sup>, whereas no butanol was detected. Microbial analyses revealed high relative abundance values for the Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Bacillus and Ruminococcus genera, with the predominance of the Clostridium genus (17%) in acid-thermal treatment reactors and the Lactobacillus genus (37%) in thermal treatment reactors. Overall, vinasse proved to be a suitable substrate for value-added SCOA production, which characterizes a potential management approach to this wastewater stream.

The pH in the bioreactor was maintained at 5.5 to inhibit consumption of H(2) by methanogens. The objective of this study was to characterize bacterial communities in the reactor operated under two different hydraulic retention times (HRTs of 30-h and 10-h) and temperatures (30 degrees C and 37 degrees C). At 30-h HRT, the H(2) production rate was 80 ml h(-1) and yield was 0.91 mol H(2)/mol glucose. At 10-h HRT, the H(2) production rate was more than 5 times higher at 436 ml h(-1), and yield was 1.61 mol H(2)/mol glucose. Samples were removed from the reactor under steady-state conditions for PCR-based detection of bacterial populations by ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (RISA). Populations detected at 30-h HRT were more diverse than at 10-h HRT and included representatives of Bacillaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae. At 10-h HRT, only Clostridiaceae were detected. When the temperature of the 10-h HRT reactor was increased from 30 degrees C to 37 degrees C, the steady-state H(2) production rate increased slightly to 463 ml h(-1) and yield was 1.8 mol H(2)/mol glucose.

26547811,Semi-continuous methane production from undiluted brown algae using a halophilic marine microbial community.,"Acclimated marine sediment-derived culture was used for semi-continuous methane production from materials equivalent to raw brown algae, without dilution of salinity and without nutrient supply, under 3 consecutive conditions of varying organic loading rates (OLRs) and hydraulic retention time (HRT). Methane production was stable at 2.0gVS/kg/day (39-day HRT); however, it became unstable at 2.9gVS/kg/day (28-day HRT) due to acetate and propionate accumulation. OLR subsequently decreased to 1.7gVS/kg/day (46-day HRT), stabilizing methane production beyond steady state. Methane yield was above 300mL/g VS at all OLRs. These results indicated that the acclimated marine sediment culture was able to produce methane semi-continuously from raw brown algae without dilution and nutrient supply under steady state. Microbial community analysis suggested that hydrogenotrophic methanogens predominated among archaea during unstable methane production, implying a partial shift of the methanogenic pathway from acetoclastic methanogenesis to acetate oxidation.

Hydrogen gas was evolved with the formation of acetate, ethanol, and butyrate by decomposition of the cellulose powder. The hydrogen production yield was 2.0 mol/mol-hexose by either batch or chemostat cultivation. A medium that did not contain peptone demonstrated a lower hydrogen production yield of 1.0 mol/mol-hexose with less formation of butyrate. The microbial community in the microflora was investigated through isolation of the microorganisms by both plating and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of the' PCR-amplified V3 region of 16S rDNA. Sixty-eight microorganisms were isolated from the microflora and classified into nine distinct groups by genetic fingerprinting of the PCR-DGGE or by a random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis and determination of the partial sequence of 16S rDNA. Most of the isolates belonged to the cluster of the thermophilic Clostridium/Bacillus subphylum of low G+C gram-positive bacteria.

33329449,Function-Driven Design of Lactic Acid Bacteria Co-cultures to Produce New Fermented Food Associating Milk and Lupin.,"Designing bacterial co-cultures adapted to ferment mixes of vegetal and animal resources for food diversification and sustainability is becoming a challenge. Among bacteria used in food fermentation, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are good candidates, as they are used as starter or adjunct in numerous fermented foods, where they allow preservation, enhanced digestibility, and improved flavor. We developed here a strategy to design LAB co-cultures able to ferment a new food made of bovine milk and lupin flour, consisting in: (i) <i>in silico</i> preselection of LAB species for targeted carbohydrate degradation; (ii) <i>in vitro</i> screening of 97 strains of the selected species for their ability to ferment carbohydrates and hydrolyze proteins from milk and lupin and clustering strains that displayed similar phenotypes; and (iii) assembling strains randomly sampled from clusters that showed complementary phenotypes. The designed co-cultures successfully expressed the targeted traits i.e., hydrolyzed proteins and degraded raffinose family oligosaccharides of lupin and lactose of milk in a large range of concentrations. They also reduced an off-flavor-generating volatile, hexanal, and produced various desirable flavor compounds. Most of the strains in co-cultures achieved higher cell counts than in monoculture, suggesting positive interactions.

Similar bacterial populations were enriched in MFCs fed with lactate, NAG, and uridine and with succinate, acetate, and formate. Cross-feeding experiments with different fuels indicated that enriched microbial consortia were able to utilize a variety of fuel sources and displayed considerable stability, efficiency, and robustness of power generation in comparison to pure cultures.

Low substrate tolerance and wide by-product profile limit microbial production of 1,3-PD by <i>Klebsiella pneumonia</i> on industrial scale. In this study, microbial consortia were investigated to overcome some disadvantages of pure fermentation by single strain. Microbial consortium named DL38 from marine sludge gave the best performance. Its bacterial community composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon high-throughput sequencing and showed that <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> was the most abundant family. Compared with three <i>K. pneumonia</i> strains isolated from DL38, the microbial consortium could grow well at an initial glycerol concentration of 200 g/L to produce 81.40 g/L of 1,3-PD with a yield of 0.63 mol/mol.

Two microbial consortia (CF and PY) with high cellulolytic activity were isolated and observed to be prone to utilize natural carbon sources. Two consortia were introduced with and without combined lactic acid bacteria (CLAB) to rice straw for up to 60 days of ensiling, and their application notably decreased the levels of structural carbohydrates and pH values of rice straw silages. Treatments that combining microbial consortia and CLAB resulted in the highest levels of lactic acid, water soluble carbohydrates, mono- and disaccharides, and lignocellulose degradation, with PY + CLAB group yielding the highest bioethanol production. The microbial consortia identified herein exhibit great potential for degrading fibrous substrates, and their combination with CLAB provides a feasible way to efficiently use rice straw for bioethanol production.",Bioresource technology,2021,None,10.1016/j.biortech.2021.125507,1,Undefined,Lignocellulose,Ethanol,,Undefined
