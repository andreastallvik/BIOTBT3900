0,9,24894538,Illumina sequencing-based analyses of bacterial communities during short-chain fatty-acid production from food waste and sewage sludge fermentation at different pH values.,"Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) can be produced by primary and waste activated sludge anaerobic fermentation. The yield and product spectrum distribution of SCFAs can be significantly affected by different initial pH values. However, most studies have focused on the physical and chemical aspects of SCFA production by waste activated sludge fermentation at different pH values. Information on the bacterial community structures during acidogenic fermentation is limited. In this study, comparisons of the bacterial communities during the co-substrate fermentation of food wastes and sewage sludge at different pH values were performed using the barcoded Illumina paired-end sequencing method. The results showed that different pH environments harbored a characteristic bacterial community, including sequences related to Lactobacillus, Prevotella, Mitsuokella, Treponema, Clostridium, and Ureibacillus. The most abundant bacterial operational taxonomic units in the different pH environments were those related to carbohydrate-degrading bacteria, which are associated with constituents of co-substrate fermentation. Further analyses showed that during organic matter fermentation, a core microbiota composed of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes existed. Comparison analyses revealed that the bacterial community during fermentation was significantly affected by the pH, and that the diverse product distribution was related to the shift in bacterial communities.

Community comparison analysis indicated that hongeo samples from different fish processing plants have a similar microbial structure at genus level, but the relative abundance of these genera showed a significant difference among different hongeo samples. Four bacterial genera including Psychrobacter, Pseudomonas, Clostridium, and Oblitimonas were detected in all hongeo samples with a high relative abundance, which associated with the nitrogen compound accumulation and ammonia flavor formation in hongeo samples. In addition, some alkaliphilic marine lactic acid bacteria (LAB) belonging to the genera Marinilactibacillus and Jeotgalibaca were detected in hongeo samples, indicating that this product might be a useful source for finding novel bacteria and possibly marine LAB. Through functional profiling analysis, it was found that hongeo samples had higher bacterial gene content related to amino acid metabolism, followed by carbohydrate metabolism and inorganic ion metabolism. The results of this study provide an important information for understanding the mechanism of quality characteristics and ammonia flavor formation in hongeo products.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2020,None,10.1016/j.foodres.2020.109030,1,"The article does not mention anything about synthetic communities or co-cultures.

5,70,25928424,Illumina MiSeq Sequencing Reveals Diverse Microbial Communities of Activated Sludge Systems Stimulated by Different Aromatics for Indigo Biosynthesis from Indole.,"Indole, as a typical N-heteroaromatic compound existed in coking wastewater, can be used for bio-indigo production. The microbial production of indigo from indole has been widely reported during the last decades using culture-dependent methods, but few studies have been carried out by microbial communities. Herein, three activated sludge systems stimulated by different aromatics, i.e. naphthalene plus indole (G1), phenol plus indole (G2) and indole only (G3), were constructed for indigo production from indole. During the operation, G1 produced the highest indigo yield in the early stage, but it switched to G3 in the late stage. Based on LC-MS analysis, indigo was the major product in G1 and G3, while the purple product 2-(7-oxo-1H-indol-6(7H)-ylidene) indolin-3-one was dominant in G2. Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons was applied to analyze the microbial community structure and composition. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and dissimilarity tests showed that the overall community structures of three groups changed significantly during the operation (P<0.05). Nevertheless, the bacteria assigned to phylum Proteobacteria, family Comamonadaceae, and genera Diaphorobacter, Comamonas and Aquamicrobium were commonly shared dominant populations. Pearson correlations were calculated to discern the relationship between microbial communities and indigo yields. The typical indigo-producing populations Comamonas and Pseudomonas showed no positive correlations with indigo yields, while there emerged many other genera that exhibited positive relationships, such as Aquamicrobium, Truepera and Pusillimonas, which had not been reported for indigo production previously. The present study should provide new insights into indigo bio-production by microbial communities from indole.

8,243,35288267,Applications of synthetic light-driven microbial consortia for biochemicals production.,"Synthetic microbial consortia provide a versatile and efficient platform for biochemicals production through the labor division. Especially, microbial communities composed of phototrophs and heterotrophs offer a promising alternative, as they can directly convert carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) into chemicals. Within this system, photoautotrophic microbes can convert CO<sub>2</sub> into organic carbon for microbial growth and metabolites synthesis by the heterotrophic partners. In return, heterotrophs can provide additional CO<sub>2</sub> to support the growth of photoautotrophic microbes. However, the unmatched growing conditions, low stability and production efficiency of synthetic microbial consortia hinder their further applications. Thus, design and construction of mutualistic and stable synthetic light-driven microbial consortia are urgently needed. In this review, the progress of synthetic light-driven microbial consortia for chemicals production was comprehensively summarized. In addition, space-efficient synthetic light-driven microbial consortia in hydrogel system were reviewed.

9,275,29736820,Microbial co-culturing systems: butanol production from organic wastes through consolidated bioprocessing.,"Biobutanol can be indigenously synthesized by solventogenic Clostridium species; however, these microorganisms possess inferior capability of utilizing abundant and renewable organic wastes, such as starch, lignocellulose, and even syngas. The common strategy to achieve direct butanol production from these organic wastes is through genetic modification of wild-type strains. However, due to the complex of butanol synthetic and hydrolytic enzymes expression systems, the recombinants show unsatisfactory results. Recently, setting up microbial co-culturing systems became more attractive, as they could not only perform more complicated tasks, but also endure changeable environments.

In this study, the interaction mechanism of microbial consortium consisting of Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum M5 and Clostridium acetobutylicum NJ4 was analyzed, which could achieve efficient butanol production from xylan through CBP. Strain M5 possesses efficient xylan degradation capability, as 19.73âg/L of xylose was accumulated within 50âhr. The efficient xylose utilization capability of partner strain NJ4 could relieve the substrate inhibition to hydrolytic enzymes of xylanase and xylosidase secreted by strain M5. In addition, the earlier solventogenesis of strain NJ4 was observed due to the existence of butyrate generated by strain M5. The mutual interaction of these two strains finally gave 13.28âg/L of butanol from 70âg/L of xylan after process optimization, representing a relatively high butanol production from hemicellulose.

12,371,32090083,Statistical Experimental Design Optimization of Microbial Proteases Production under Co-Culture Conditions for Chitin Recovery from Speckled Shrimp <i>Metapenaeus monoceros</i> By-Product.,"This study was designed with the aim to produce microbial proteases in presence of speckled shrimp by-product. For this reason, three strains belonging to <i>Bacillus</i> genus, namely, <i>Aeribacillus pallidus</i> VP3, <i>Lysinibacillus fusiformis</i> C250R, and <i>Anoxybacillus kamchatkensis</i> M1V were studied under co-culture procedure. A Taguchi L27 experimental design was applied to optimize the co-culture parameters. The experimental design was built with 9 factors (by-product powder concentration, the pH of the medium, the temperature, the sucrose concentration, the agitation speed, the inoculum sizes of VP3, M1V, and C250R strains, and the culture volume) at three different levels. The obtained results showed that a total protease activity of 8,182âU/mL could be achieved after 24âh of incubation in presence of 20âg/L shrimp by-product and 10âg/L sucrose, at an initial pH of 7, a 40Â°C temperature and absorbance, at 600ânm, of inoculum sizes of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.1 for VP3, M1V, and C250R strains, respectively. The agitation was set at 200ârpm, and the final volume was 25âmL. Taguchi's design allowed the identification of temperature, the inoculum size for strain VP3, the inoculum size for strain M1V, and the final culture volume as the most influencing variables. A Box-Behnken design with 27 experiments was carried out for the optimization of these four selected factors. Following such design, the highest protease production reached was 11,300âU/mL.

Previously, BCP was shown to decrease nitrogen (N) leaching from the soil, but the effects of BCP on the diversity, composition, and structure of soil microbial communities are not well understood. Here, we applied 1.5 mg BCP-C to acidic soil (pH 3.5) at a range of different water contents (from 40 % to 100 % water holding capacity) to investigate the interactions between BCP and increasing water holding capacity on the diversity, composition, and interactions of soil microbial communities. Distance-based multivariate linear model (DistLM) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analyses showed that BCP caused larger changes in fungal than bacterial communities, while soil water content had a greater effect on bacterial communities relative to fungal communities. Co-occurrence network analyses indicated that BCP amendment produced more robust and complex bacterial networks and more stable fungal ones. BCP significantly increased the OTU numbers of beneficial microbes (e.g., Trichoderma spp.) in all water contents, with fewer OTU numbers of putative pathogenetic species (Fusarium spp. and Aspergillus spp.).

16,474,33990298,Propionate Production from Carbon Monoxide by Synthetic Cocultures of Acetobacterium wieringae and Propionigenic Bacteria.,"Gas fermentation is a promising way to convert CO-rich gases to chemicals. We studied the use of synthetic cocultures composed of carboxydotrophic and propionigenic bacteria to convert CO to propionate. So far, isolated carboxydotrophs cannot directly ferment CO to propionate, and therefore, this cocultivation approach was investigated. Four distinct synthetic cocultures were constructed, consisting of Acetobacterium wieringae (DSM 1911<sup>T</sup>) and Pelobacter propionicus (DSM 2379<sup>T</sup>), <i>Ac. wieringae</i> (DSM 1911<sup>T</sup>) and Anaerotignum neopropionicum (DSM 3847<sup>T</sup>), <i>Ac. wieringae</i> strain JM and <i>P. propionicus</i> (DSM 2379<sup>T</sup>), and <i>Ac. wieringae</i> strain JM and <i>An. neopropionicum</i> (DSM 3847<sup>T</sup>). Propionate was produced by all the cocultures, with the highest titer (â¼24âmM) being measured in the coculture composed of <i>Ac. wieringae</i> strain JM and <i>An. neopropionicum</i>, which also produced isovalerate (â¼4âmM), butyrate (â¼1âmM), and isobutyrate (0.3âmM). This coculture was further studied using proteogenomics. As expected, enzymes involved in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway in <i>Ac. wieringae</i> strain JM, which are responsible for the conversion of CO to ethanol and acetate, were detected; the proteome of <i>An. neopropionicum</i> confirmed the conversion of ethanol to propionate via the acrylate pathway. In addition, proteins related to amino acid metabolism and stress response were highly abundant during cocultivation, which raises the hypothesis that amino acids are exchanged by the two microorganisms, accompanied by isovalerate and isobutyrate production. This highlights the importance of explicitly looking at fortuitous microbial interactions during cocultivation to fully understand coculture behavior. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Syngas fermentation has great potential for the sustainable production of chemicals from wastes (via prior gasification) and flue gases containing CO/CO<sub>2</sub>. Research efforts need to be directed toward expanding the product portfolio of gas fermentation, which is currently limited to mainly acetate and ethanol. This study provides the basis for a microbial process to produce propionate from CO using synthetic cocultures composed of acetogenic and propionigenic bacteria and elucidates the metabolic pathways involved. Furthermore, based on proteomics results, we hypothesize that the two bacterial species engage in an interaction that results in amino acid exchange, which subsequently promotes isovalerate and isobutyrate production. These findings provide a new understanding of gas fermentation and a coculturing strategy for expanding the product spectrum of microbial conversion of CO/CO<sub>2</sub>.",Applied and environmental microbiology,2021,8231444,10.1128/AEM.02839-20,1,The scientific article concerns product production using a synthetic community or co-culture.
17,518,28429329,Hydrogen production and microbial kinetics of Clostridium termitidis in mono-culture and co-culture with Clostridium beijerinckii on cellulose.,"Cellulose utilization by hydrogen producers remains an issue due to the low hydrogen yields reported and the pretreatment of cellulose prior to fermentation requires complex and expensive steps.

22,690,30060435,Kinetics and microbial community analysis for hydrogen production using raw grass inoculated with different pretreated mixed culture.,"In this study, five pretreatment methods (heat shock, acid, base, aeration and gamma radiation) were applied for enriching hydrogen producers from anaerobically digested sludge, aiming to compare their hydrogen fermentation performance using raw ryegrass as substrate. Results showed that various pretreatment methods caused great variations on grass hydrogen fermentation performance. Acid pretreatment was most efficient compared with other tested pretreatment methods, with relevant hydrogen yield of 64.4mL/g dry grass and organics removal of 31.4%. Kinetics results showed that the first-order kinetic model fitted hydrogen evolution better than the modified Gompertz model. Microbiological analysis showed that various pretreatment methods caused great variations on microbial activity and microbial community composition. Clostridium and Enterococcus were two dominant genera, while relative abundances of these two genera varied greatly for different pretreated samples. Difference in microbial activity and microbial community distribution induced by the pretreatment methods might directly cause different ryegrass fermentation performance.",Bioresource technology,2018,None,10.1016/j.biortech.2017.09.041,1,The scientific article does not mention anything about a synthetic community or co-culture.

In-depth microbiome characterization was also conducted by high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene using the Miseq Illumina platform. SCOA production was 47.3 % higher in vinasse-fed reactors, with isobutyric (up to 10.3Â gÂ L<sup>-1</sup>) and butyric (up to 10.6Â gÂ L<sup>-1</sup>) acids as the primary metabolites most likely resulting from lactate conversion. Ethanol comprised the main product from solventogenic pathways in all conditions, with values ranging between 2.7 and 5.2Â gÂ L<sup>-1</sup>, whereas no butanol was detected. Microbial analyses revealed high relative abundance values for the Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Bacillus and Ruminococcus genera, with the predominance of the Clostridium genus (17%) in acid-thermal treatment reactors and the Lactobacillus genus (37%) in thermal treatment reactors. Overall, vinasse proved to be a suitable substrate for value-added SCOA production, which characterizes a potential management approach to this wastewater stream. In this sense, the biochemical production of butyrate from vinasse could diversify the product portfolio of sugarcane biorefineries, also minimizing bioenergy losses by converting residual carbon fractions.",Journal of bioscience and bioengineering,2019,None,10.1016/j.jbiosc.2018.10.008,1,"This scientific article does not specifically mention the use of a synthetic community or co-culture.

24,770,15558274,H2-producing bacterial communities from a heat-treated soil inoculum.,"Hydrogen gas (approximately 60% H(2)) was produced in a continuous flow bioreactor inoculated with heat-treated soil, and fed synthetic wastewater containing glucose (9.5 g l(-1)). The pH in the bioreactor was maintained at 5.5 to inhibit consumption of H(2) by methanogens. The objective of this study was to characterize bacterial communities in the reactor operated under two different hydraulic retention times (HRTs of 30-h and 10-h) and temperatures (30 degrees C and 37 degrees C). At 30-h HRT, the H(2) production rate was 80 ml h(-1) and yield was 0.91 mol H(2)/mol glucose. At 10-h HRT, the H(2) production rate was more than 5 times higher at 436 ml h(-1), and yield was 1.61 mol H(2)/mol glucose. Samples were removed from the reactor under steady-state conditions for PCR-based detection of bacterial populations by ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (RISA). Populations detected at 30-h HRT were more diverse than at 10-h HRT and included representatives of Bacillaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae. At 10-h HRT, only Clostridiaceae were detected. When the temperature of the 10-h HRT reactor was increased from 30 degrees C to 37 degrees C, the steady-state H(2) production rate increased slightly to 463 ml h(-1) and yield was 1.8 mol H(2)/mol glucose.

The substrate used was made of meat-based wastes, especially from slaughterhouses, which are becoming available in large amounts as a consequence of the growing constraints for waste disposal from meat industry. A reconstituted microbial mesophilic consortium without Archaebacteria (methanogens), named PBr, was cultivated in a 5-L anaerobic bioreactor on slaughterhouse wastes. The experiments were carried out with sequential fed-batch operations, including liquid medium removal from the bioreactor and addition of fresh substrate. VFAs and nitrogen were the main metabolites observed, while hydrogen accumulation was very low and no methane production was evidenced. After 1,300 h of culture, yields obtained for VFAs reached 0.38 g/g dry matter.

28,903,34129600,Designing microbial communities to maximize the thermodynamic driving force for the production of chemicals.,"Microbial communities have become a major research focus due to their importance for biogeochemical cycles, biomedicine and biotechnological applications. While some biotechnological applications, such as anaerobic digestion, make use of naturally arising microbial communities, the rational design of microbial consortia for bio-based production processes has recently gained much interest. One class of synthetic microbial consortia is based on specifically designed strains of one species. A common design principle for these consortia is based on division of labor, where the entire production pathway is divided between the different strains to reduce the metabolic burden caused by product synthesis. We first show that classical division of labor does not automatically reduce the metabolic burden when metabolic flux per biomass is analyzed. We then present ASTHERISC (Algorithmic Search of THERmodynamic advantages in Single-species Communities), a new computational approach for designing multi-strain communities of a single-species with the aim to divide a production pathway between different strains such that the thermodynamic driving force for product synthesis is maximized. ASTHERISC exploits the fact that compartmentalization of segments of a product pathway in different strains can circumvent thermodynamic bottlenecks arising when operation of one reaction requires a metabolite with high and operation of another reaction the same metabolite with low concentration. We implemented the ASTHERISC algorithm in a dedicated program package and applied it on E. coli core and genome-scale models with different settings, for example, regarding number of strains or demanded product yield. These calculations showed that, for each scenario, many target metabolites (products) exist where a multi-strain community can provide a thermodynamic advantage compared to a single strain solution. In some cases, a production with sufficiently high yield is thermodynamically only feasible with a community. In summary, the developed ASTHERISC approach provides a promising new principle for designing microbial communities for the bio-based production of chemicals.",PLoS computational biology,2021,8232427,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009093,1,The article concerns product production using a synthetic community.

Methane production was stable at 2.0gVS/kg/day (39-day HRT); however, it became unstable at 2.9gVS/kg/day (28-day HRT) due to acetate and propionate accumulation. OLR subsequently decreased to 1.7gVS/kg/day (46-day HRT), stabilizing methane production beyond steady state. Methane yield was above 300mL/g VS at all OLRs. These results indicated that the acclimated marine sediment culture was able to produce methane semi-continuously from raw brown algae without dilution and nutrient supply under steady state. Microbial community analysis suggested that hydrogenotrophic methanogens predominated among archaea during unstable methane production, implying a partial shift of the methanogenic pathway from acetoclastic methanogenesis to acetate oxidation.

A metagenomic analysis indicated that bacterial phylotypes dominated the microbial community, with a relatively small contribution of archaea and fungal taxa. The relative abundance of beneficial bacterial taxa increased significantly in response to the MCB product treatment. Notably, a higher relative abundance of bacterial taxa with carbon fixation, carbon-degrading and nitrogen metabolism properties were observed in the MCB product-treated potato rhizosphere. This was also reflected in the identification of a greater abundance of genes encoding enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism, carbon fixation and carbon degradation pathways in the conducted metagenomic analysis. The greater relative abundance of these beneficial bacterial taxa in the rhizosphere of MCB product-treated plots, as well as the higher abundance of genes associated with the indicated cellular processes, were associated with an increase in tuber yield.

Conceptionally, this can be realized by specialized single microbial strains or by co-culturing various strain combinations. In the latter approach strains for substrate conversion and for product formation can be combined. This study addressed the construction of binary microbial consortia based on starch- and sucrose-based production of l-lysine and derived value-added compounds. A commensalism-based synthetic consortium for l-lysine production from sucrose was developed combining an l-lysine auxotrophic, naturally sucrose-negative E. coli strain with a C. glutamicum strain able to produce l-lysine that secretes fructose when grown with sucrose due to deletion of the fructose importer gene ptsF. Mutualistic synthetic consortia with an l-lysine auxotrophic, Î±-amylase secreting E. coli strain and naturally amylase-negative C. glutamicum strains was implemented for production of valuable fine chemicals from starch.",Bioresource technology,2018,None,10.1016/j.biortech.2018.03.113,1,The article concerns the production of l-lysine using a synthetic community.

Furthermore, whole-cell immobilization was performed using magnetic nanoparticle (MNP)-loaded polymers to develop an efficient bioprocess. The anaerobic digestion of WS by cattle dung yielded 219 L/kg of total solids reduced. Methanol produced was 5.08 and 6.39Â mmol/L by pure- and co-cultures from biogas, respectively. The optimization of process parameters enhanced methanol production to 6.82Â mmol/L by co-culturing Mithylosinus sporium and Methylocella tundrae. The immobilized co-culture within the MNP-doped polymers exhibited much higher cumulative methanol of up to 70.74Â mmol/L than the production of 22.34Â mmol/L by free cells after ten cycles of reuse. This study suggests that MNP-doped polymer-based immobilization of methanotrophs is a unique approach for producing renewable fuels from biomass-derived biogas, a greenhouse gas.",Bioresource technology,2022,None,10.1016/j.biortech.2022.128032,1,"Yes, this article does concern product production using a synthetic community or co-culture."
45,1415,34235138,Product Inhibition and pH Affect Stoichiometry and Kinetics of Chain Elongating Microbial Communities in Sequencing Batch Bioreactors.,"Anaerobic microbial communities can produce carboxylic acids of medium chain length (e.g., caproate, caprylate) by elongating short chain fatty acids through reversed Î²-oxidation. Ethanol is a common electron donor for this process. The influence of environmental conditions on the stoichiometry and kinetics of ethanol-based chain elongation remains elusive. Here, a sequencing batch bioreactor setup with high-resolution off-gas measurements was used to identify the physiological characteristics of chain elongating microbial communities enriched on acetate and ethanol at pH 7.0 Â± 0.2 and 5.5 Â± 0.2. Operation at both pH-values led to the development of communities that were highly enriched (>50%, based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) in <i>Clostridium kluyveri</i> related species. At both pH-values, stably performing cultures were characterized by incomplete substrate conversion and decreasing biomass-specific hydrogen production rates during an operational cycle. The process stoichiometries obtained at both pH-values were different: at pH 7.0, 71 Â± 6% of the consumed electrons were converted to caproate, compared to only 30 Â± 5% at pH 5.5. Operating at pH 5.5 led to a decrease in the biomass yield, but a significant increase in the biomass-specific substrate uptake rate, suggesting that the organisms employ catabolic overcapacity to deal with energy losses associated to product inhibition. These results highlight that chain elongating conversions rely on a delicate balance between substrate uptake- and product inhibition kinetics.",Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,2021,8256265,10.3389/fbioe.2021.693030,1,The article is about product production using a synthetic community.

47,1540,30349057,Human gut microbe co-cultures have greater potential than monocultures for food waste remediation to commodity chemicals.,"Food waste represents an underutilized resource for commodity chemical generation. Constituents of the human gut microbiota that are already adapted to a food waste stream could be repurposed for useful chemical production. Industrial fermentations utilizing these microbes maintain organisms in isolation; however, microbial consortia offer an attractive alternative to monocultures in that metabolic interactions may result in more efficient processes with higher yields. Here we computationally assess the ability of co-cultures vs. monocultures to anaerobically convert a Western diet to commodity chemicals. The combination of genome-scale metabolic models with flux-balance analysis predicts that every organism analyzed can benefit from interactions with another microbe, as evidenced by increased biomass fluxes in co-culture vs. monoculture. Furthermore, microbe combinations result in emergent or increased commodity chemical production including butanol, methane, formaldehyde, propionate, hydrogen gas, and urea. These overproducing co-cultures are enriched for mutualistic and commensal interactions. Using Clostridium beijerinckii co-cultures as representative examples, models predict cross-fed metabolites will simultaneously modify multiple internal pathways, evident by different internal metabolic network structures. Differences in degree and betweenness centrality of hub precursor metabolites were correlated to C. beijerinckii metabolic outputs, and thus demonstrate the potential of co-cultures to differentially direct metabolisms to useful products.",Scientific reports,2018,6197241,10.1038/s41598-018-33733-z,1,"The article is about using co-cultures to produce commodity chemicals, not synthetic communities."

Identification of key bacteria responsible for SMP production is essential for mitigation of membrane fouling. Here, we investigated the effect of microbial interaction on membrane fouling. We measured the membrane fouling potentials of 13 bacterial strains isolated from a pilot-scale MBR treating domestic wastewater when they were cultivated as single-culture and co-culture. We found that fouling-causing bacteria (FCB) displayed much higher fouling potential when co-cultured even with non-FCB and mixed population (activated sludge). In particular, the fouling potential of strain S26, one of FCB, increased 26.8 times when cultivated with strain S22 (fouling-enhancing bacteria, FEB). The secretion of N-octanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C8-HSL) was increased by co-cultivating S22 and S26 as compared with cultivating as single culture, which stimulated the production of fouling-causing SMP by S26 and consequently resulted in severe membrane fouling. This result suggests that AHL-mediated quorum-sensing (QS) regulatory system was involved in secretion of fouling-causing SMP.",Scientific reports,2017,5559553,10.1038/s41598-017-09023-5,1,The article is concerned with product production using a co-culture.

Fermentation of the protein-rich product by uncontrolled bacterial community can result in high amounts of hazardous biogenic amines (BA). This study aimed to unveil dynamics of microbial community and its relation to BA accumulation in nham. Three batches of nham were analyzed for pH, lactic acid bacteria population, concentrations of organic acids and BA. Bacterial communities were analyzed by pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. In all batches, pH dropped to the quality standard of nham (â¤4.6) within 3-5â¯days by production of lactic acid and acetic acid. Initial BA levels varied batch-by-batch and increased with fermentation time. In the highest quality batch, levels of histamine, tyramine, and total BA were within the recommended safety limits (200, 100 and 1000â¯mg/kg, respectively) throughout the 10-days study. However, in other batches, unsafe levels of tyramine and total BA were found after 5â¯days of fermentation. The results indicated that over-fermentation and inferior conditions of ingredients increased risk due to high levels of BA. Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Pediococcus and Weissella were prevalent and comprised >90% of total bacteria during fermentation. Weissella was predominant in the batch with low BA while Lactobacillus and Pediococcus were predominant in the higher BA batches. A negative correlation between Weissella dominance and total BA was observed (râ¯=â¯-0.90, pâ¯=â¯.003). A 10% increase in dominance of Weissella was associated with 75-170â¯mg/kg decrease in total BA. W. hellenica was the species prevalent only in low BA batch.

51,1574,11693936,Changes in product formation and bacterial community by dilution rate on carbohydrate fermentation by methanogenic microflora in continuous flow stirred tank reactor.,"Changes in product formation during carbohydrate fermentation by anaerobic microflora in a continuous flow stirred tank reactor were investigated with respect to the dilution rate in the reactor. In the fermentation by methanogenic microflora, stable methane fermentation, producing methane and carbon dioxide, was observed at relatively low dilution rates (less than 0.33 d(-1) on glucose and 0.20 d(-1) on cellulose). Decomposition of cellulose in the medium was a rate-limiting step in the reaction, because glucose was easily consumed at all applied dilution rates (0.07-4.81 d(-1)). Intermediate metabolites of methane fermentation, such as lactate, ethanol, acetate, butyrate, formate, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide, were accumulated as dilution rate increased. Maximum yield of hydrogen was obtained at 4.81 d(-1) of dilution rate (0.1 mol/mol glucose on glucose or 0.7 mol/mol hexose on cellulose). Lactate was the major product on glucose (1.2 mol/mol glucose), whereas ethanol was predominant on cellulose (0.7 mol/mol hexose). An analysis by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified bacterial 16S rDNA of the microflora indicated that changes in the microbial community took place at various dilution rates, and these changes appeared to correspond to the changes in product distributions. Sequence analyses of the DGGE fragments revealed the probable major population of the microflora. A band closely related to the microorganisms of thermophilic anaerobic bacteria was detected with strong intensity on both glucose and cellulose. Differences in the production yield of hydrogen could have been caused by different populations of microorganisms in each microflora. In the case of cellulose, increasing the dilution rate brought about an accumulation of microorganisms related to Clostridia species that have cellulolytic activity, this being in accordance with the notion of cellulose decomposition being the rate-limiting reaction.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2001,None,10.1007/s002530100760,1,"The article does not specifically mention whether the community used is synthetic or not, but it seems likely that it is not synthetic, as the changes in product formation and microbial community are likely to be due to the different composition of the community."

Heat treatment is widely applied as an inoculum pre-treatment due to its effectiveness in inhibiting methanogenic microflora but it may not exclusively select for hydrogen-producing bacteria. This work evaluated the effects of heat treatment on microbial viability and structure of anaerobic granular sludge. Heat treatment was carried out on granular sludge at 100 Â°C with four residence times (0.5, 1, 2 and 4 h). Hydrogen production of treated sludges was studied from glucose by means of batch test at different pH values. Results indicated that each heat treatment strongly influenced the granular sludge resulting in microbial communities having different hydrogen productions. The highest hydrogen yields (2.14 moles of hydrogen per mole of glucose) were obtained at pH 5.5 using the sludge treated for 4 h characterized by the lowest CFU concentration (2.3 Ã 10(3)CFU/g sludge).

Low substrate tolerance and wide by-product profile limit microbial production of 1,3-PD by <i>Klebsiella pneumonia</i> on industrial scale. In this study, microbial consortia were investigated to overcome some disadvantages of pure fermentation by single strain. Microbial consortium named DL38 from marine sludge gave the best performance. Its bacterial community composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon high-throughput sequencing and showed that <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> was the most abundant family.

62,1833,23959872,Design and characterization of synthetic fungal-bacterial consortia for direct production of isobutanol from cellulosic biomass.,"Synergistic microbial communities are ubiquitous in nature and exhibit appealing features, such as sophisticated metabolic capabilities and robustness. This has inspired fast-growing interest in engineering synthetic microbial consortia for biotechnology development. However, there are relatively few reports of their use in real-world applications, and achieving population stability and regulation has proven to be challenging. In this work, we bridge ecology theory with engineering principles to develop robust synthetic fungal-bacterial consortia for efficient biosynthesis of valuable products from lignocellulosic feedstocks. The required biological functions are divided between two specialists: the fungus Trichoderma reesei, which secretes cellulase enzymes to hydrolyze lignocellulosic biomass into soluble saccharides, and the bacterium Escherichia coli, which metabolizes soluble saccharides into desired products. We developed and experimentally validated a comprehensive mathematical model for T. reesei/E. coli consortia, providing insights on key determinants of the system's performance. To illustrate the bioprocessing potential of this consortium, we demonstrate direct conversion of microcrystalline cellulose and pretreated corn stover to isobutanol. Without costly nutrient supplementation, we achieved titers up to 1.88 g/L and yields up to 62% of theoretical maximum.

The elucidation of anaerobic activated sludge microbial community utilizing monosaccharides will lay an important foundation for the industrialization of biohydrogen production. In this study, the hydrogen production by a mixed microbial culture on four monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, galactose and arabinose) was investigated in a batch cultures. The mixed microbial culture was obtained from anaerobic activated sludge in a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) after 29 days of acclimatization. The results indicated that glucose had the highest specific hydrogen production rate of 358 mL/g.g mixed liquid volatile suspended solid (MLVSS), while arabinose had the lowest hydrogen production rate of 28 mL/g.gMLVSS. Glucose also possessed the highest specific conversion rate to hydrogen of 82 mL/g glucose, while fructose had the highest specific conversion rate to liquid product of 443 mg/g fructose. Arabinose had the lowest conversion rates to both liquid products and hydrogen. Metabolic pathways and fermentation products were the major reasons for the difference in hydrogen production from these four monosaccharides. The complex fermentation pathways of arabinose reduced its hydrogen production efficiency and a long acclimation period (over 68 h) was required before the anaerobic activated sludge could effectively utilize arabinose in batch cultures.",Bioresource technology,2008,None,10.1016/j.biortech.2007.11.072,1,"The article does not specifically mention whether the community used is synthetic or not, but it seems likely that it is not synthetic since it is taken from an existing activated sludge system."
64,1979,32897644,Applications of microbial co-cultures in polyketides production.,"Polyketides are a large group of natural biomolecules that are normally produced by bacteria, fungi and plants. These molecules have clinical importance due to their anti-cancer, anti-microbial, anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Polyketides are biosynthesized from units of acyl-CoA by different polyketide synthases (PKSs), which display wide diversity of functional domains and mechanisms of action between fungi and bacteria. Co-culture of different micro-organisms can produce novel products distinctive from those produced during single cultures. This study compared the new polyketides produced in such co-culture systems and discusses aspects of the cultivation systems, product structures and identification techniques. Current results indicate that the formation of new polyketides may be the result of activation of previously silent PKSs genes induced during co-culture. This review indicated a potential way to produce pure therapeutic polyketides by microbial fermentation and a potential way to develop functional foods and agricultural products using co-co-culture of different micro-organisms. It also pointed out a new perspective for studies on the process of functional foods, especially those involving multiple micro-organisms.",Journal of applied microbiology,2021,None,10.1111/jam.14845,1,The article discusses the production of polyketides using co-culture systems.

The results showed that the anaerobic co-digestion of these materials enhanced the hydrogen content by 62.4% (v/v), 29.89% higher than that obtained by FW digestion alone, and the total VFA production reached at 281.84â¯mg/g volatile solid (VS), a 8.38% increase. This enhancement was primarily resulted from improvements in the multi-substrate characteristics, which were obtained by supplying a higher soluble chemical oxygen demand (23.78-32.14â¯g/L) and suitable a pH (6.12-6.51), decreasing total ammonia nitrogen by 18.67% and ensuring a proper carbon/nitrogen ratio (15.01-23.01). Furthermore, maximal hydrogen (62.39â¯mL/g VS) and total VFA production potential (294.63â¯mg/g VS) were estimated using response surface methodology optimization, which yielded FW percentages of 85.17% and 79.87%, respectively.

A study of bacterial community.,"This study investigated bacterial communities during aerobic food waste co-composting degradation of highly PCDD/F-contaminated field soil. The total initial toxic equivalent quantity (TEQ) of the soil was 16,004â¯ng-TEQâ¯kg<sup>-1</sup> dry weight. After 42-day composting and bioactivity-enhanced monitored natural attenuation (MNA), the final compost product's TEQ reduced to 1916â¯ng-TEQâ¯kg<sup>-1</sup> dry weight (approximately 75% degradation) with a degradation rate of 136.33â¯ng-TEQâ¯kg<sup>-1</sup>â¯day<sup>-1</sup>. Variations in bacterial communities and PCDD/F degraders were identified by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Thermophilic conditions of the co-composting process resulted in fewer observed bacteria and PCDD/F concentrations. Numerous organic compound degraders were identified by NGS, supporting the conclusion that PCDD/Fs were degraded during food waste co-composting. Bacterial communities of the composting process were defined by four phyla (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes). At the genus level, Bacillus (Firmicutes) emerged as the most dominant phylotype.

However, bispecific-antibody design and production remain challenging, owing to the need to incorporate two distinct heavy and light chain pairs while maintaining natural nonimmunogenic antibody architecture. Here we present a bispecific-antibody production strategy that relies on co-culture of two bacterial strains, each expressing a half-antibody. Using this approach, we produce 28 unique bispecific antibodies. A bispecific antibody against the receptor tyrosine kinases MET and EGFR binds both targets monovalently, inhibits their signaling, and suppresses MET and EGFR-driven cell and tumor growth. Our strategy allows rapid generation of bispecific antibodies from any two existing antibodies and yields milligram to gram quantities of bispecific antibodies sufficient for a wide range of discovery and preclinical applications.

One approach utilises long fusion primers and a single PCR (one-step) while another utilises shorter primers in a first reaction, before transferring diluted amplicons to a second reaction for barcode index incorporation (two-step). We investigated whether transferring diluted amplicons risked creating artificially simplified, poorly diverse communities. In soils from three sites with paired cropland and forest, one-step yielded higher alpha-diversity indices, including detection of two-four times more unique taxa. Modelling expected taxa per sequence observation predicted that one-step reaches full coverage by 104 sequences per sample while two-step needs 105-109. Comparisons of rank abundance demonstrated that two-step covered only 38%-69% of distributions. Beta-diversity showed better separation of communities in response to land use change under one-step, although both approaches showed a significant effect. Driving differences was underestimation of relatively minor taxa with the two-step procedure. These taxa were low in abundance, yet play important roles in carbon cycling, secondary metabolite production, anaerobic metabolism, and bacterial predation.

As a model system for developing a meta-omic approach to identify and characterize natural product pathways from invertebrate-derived microbial consortia, we chose to investigate the ET-743 (Yondelis) biosynthetic pathway. This molecule is an approved anticancer agent obtained in low abundance (10(-4)-10(-5) % w/w) from the tunicate Ecteinascidia turbinata and is generated in suitable quantities for clinical use by a lengthy semisynthetic process. On the basis of structural similarities to three bacterial secondary metabolites, we hypothesized that ET-743 is the product of a marine bacterial symbiont. Using metagenomic sequencing of total DNA from the tunicate/microbial consortium, we targeted and assembled a 35 kb contig containing 25 genes that comprise the core of the NRPS biosynthetic pathway for this valuable anticancer agent. Rigorous sequence analysis based on codon usage of two large unlinked contigs suggests that Candidatus Endoecteinascidia frumentensis produces the ET-743 metabolite. Subsequent metaproteomic analysis confirmed expression of three key biosynthetic proteins. Moreover, the predicted activity of an enzyme for assembly of the tetrahydroisoquinoline core of ET-743 was verified in vitro.

The degradation products were analyzed by FTIR, GC-FID, tensile strength, and SEM. The bacterial consortia were characterized by 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing. The formulated bacterial consortia demonstrated 81Â Â±Â 4 and 38Â Â±Â 3Â % of weight reduction for LDPE strips and LDPE pellets, respectively, over a period of 120Â days. However, the consortia formulated by MTCC strains demonstrated 49Â Â±Â 4 and 20Â Â±Â 2Â % of weight reduction for LDPE strips and pellets, respectively, for the same period. Furthermore, the three isolates in its individual application exhibited 70Â Â±Â 4, 68Â Â±Â 4, and 64Â Â±Â 4Â % weight reduction for LDPE strips and 21Â Â±Â 2, 28Â Â±Â 2, 24Â Â±Â 2Â % weight reduction for LDPE pellets over a period of 120Â days (pÂ <Â 0.05). The end product analysis showed structural changes and formation of bacterial film on degraded LDPE strips. The 16S rDNA characterization of bacterial consortia revealed that these organisms were novel strains and designated as Enterobacter sp. bengaluru-btdsce01, Enterobacter sp. bengaluru-btdsce02, and Pantoea sp. bengaluru-btdsce03. The current study thus suggests that industrial scale-up of these microbial consortia probably provides better insights for waste management of LDPE and similar types of plastic garbage.

85,2798,34303101,Ensiling pretreatment with two novel microbial consortia enhances bioethanol production in sterile rice straw.,"The present study extracts and enriches cellulolytic microbial consortia from yak (Bos grunniens) and evaluates their effects on the fermentation profile and bioethanol yield in rice straw silage. Two microbial consortia (CF and PY) with high cellulolytic activity were isolated and observed to be prone to utilize natural carbon sources. Two consortia were introduced with and without combined lactic acid bacteria (CLAB) to rice straw for up to 60Â days of ensiling, and their application notably decreased the levels of structural carbohydrates and pH values of rice straw silages. Treatments that combining microbial consortia and CLAB resulted in the highest levels of lactic acid, water soluble carbohydrates, mono- and disaccharides, and lignocellulose degradation, with PYÂ +Â CLAB group yielding the highest bioethanol production. The microbial consortia identified herein exhibit great potential for degrading fibrous substrates, and their combination with CLAB provides a feasible way to efficiently use rice straw for bioethanol production.",Bioresource technology,2021,None,10.1016/j.biortech.2021.125507,1,"The article does not mention anything about synthetic communities or co-cultures, so it is difficult to say for certain. However, based on the fact that the article discusses the use of microorganisms to pretreat rice straw for bioethanol production, it is likely that the consortia mentioned are synthetic communities or co-cultures."
86,2803,29233009,Microbial consortia: a critical look at microalgae co-cultures for enhanced biomanufacturing.,"Monocultures have been the preferred production route in the bio-industry, where contamination has been a major bottleneck. In nature, microorganisms usually exist as part of organized communities and consortia, gaining benefits from co-habitation, keeping invaders at bay. There is increasing interest in the use of co-cultures to tackle contamination issues, and simultaneously increase productivity and product diversity. The feasibility of extending the natural phenomenon of co-habitation to the biomanufacturing industry in the form of co-cultures requires careful and systematic consideration of several aspects. This article will critically examine and review current work on microbial co-cultures, with the intent of examining the concept and proposing a design pipeline that can be developed in a biomanufacturing context.",Critical reviews in biotechnology,2018,None,10.1080/07388551.2017.1390728,1,This article concerns the potential use of co-cultures to increase productivity and product diversity in the bio-industry. The article does not specifically mention the use of synthetic communities or co-cultures.
87,2870,30055268,Sharpea and Kandleria are lactic acid producing rumen bacteria that do not change their fermentation products when co-cultured with a methanogen.,"Sharpea and Kandleria are associated with rumen samples from low-methane-emitting sheep. Four strains of each genus were studied in culture, and the genomes of nine strains were analysed, to understand the physiology of these bacteria. All eight cultures grew equally well with d-glucose, d-fructose, d-galactose, cellobiose, and sucrose supplementation. d-Lactate was the major end product, with small amounts of the mixed acid fermentation products formate, acetate and ethanol. Genes encoding the enzymes necessary for this fermentation pattern were found in the genomes of four strains of Sharpea and five of Kandleria. Strains of Sharpea produced traces of hydrogen gas in pure culture, but strains of Kandleria did not. This was consistent with finding that Sharpea, but not Kandleria, genomes contained genes coding for hydrogenases. It was speculated that, in co-culture with a methanogen, Sharpea and Kandleria might change their fermentation pattern from a predominately homolactic to a predominately mixed acid fermentation, which would result in a decrease in lactate production and an increase in formation of acetate and perhaps ethanol. However, Sharpea and Kandleria did not change their fermentation products when co-cultured with Methanobrevibacter olleyae, a methanogen that can use both hydrogen and formate, and lactate remained the major end product. The results of this study therefore support a hypothesis that explains the link between lower methane yields and larger populations of Sharpea and Kandleria in the rumens of sheep.",Anaerobe,2018,None,10.1016/j.anaerobe.2018.07.008,1,"The article does not specifically mention whether the Sharpea and Kandleria bacteria are being studied in a synthetic community or co-culture. However, the article does mention that the bacteria are being studied in culture, and that they are being co-cultured with a methanogen.

88,2976,27680538,Engineering of a microbial coculture of Escherichia coli strains for the biosynthesis of resveratrol.,"Resveratrol is a plant natural product with many health-protecting effects which makes it an attractive chemical both for academic studies and industrial purposes. However, the low quantities naturally produced by plants as well as the unsustainable procedures of extraction, purification and concentration have prompted many biotechnological approaches to produce this chemical in large quantities from renewable sources. None of these approaches have considered a microbial coculture strategy to produce this compound. The aim of this study was to prove the functionality of a microbial coculture for the biosynthesis of resveratrol.",Microbial cell factories,2016,5041211,10.1186/s12934-016-0562-z,1,The article does not mention anything about a synthetic community or co-culture specifically.

89,2985,27681917,Highly Variable Bacterial Communities Associated with the Octocoral Antillogorgia elisabethae.,"Antillogorgia elisabethae (synonymous with Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae) is a common branching octocoral in Caribbean reef ecosystems. A. elisabethae is a rich source of anti-inflammatory diterpenes, thus this octocoral has been the subject of numerous natural product investigations, yet relatively little is known regarding the composition, diversity and the geographic and temporal stability of its microbiome. To characterize the composition, diversity and stability of bacterial communities of Bahamian A. elisabethae populations, 17 A. elisabethae samples originating from five sites within The Bahamas were characterized by 16S rDNA pyrosequencing. A. elisabethae bacterial communities were less diverse and distinct from those of surrounding seawater samples. Analyses of Î±- and Î²-diversity revealed that A. elisabethae bacterial communities were highly variable between A. elisabethae samples from The Bahamas. This contrasts results obtained from a previous study of three specimens collected from Providencia Island, Colombia, which found A. elisabethae bacterial communities to be highly structured. Taxa belonging to the Rhodobacteriales, Rhizobiales, Flavobacteriales and Oceanospiralles were identified as potential members of the A. elisabethae core microbiome.

90,2996,32645575,Co-culturing microalgae with endophytic bacteria increases nutrient removal efficiency for biogas purification.,"Endophytic bacteria were isolated from Chlorella vulgaris and co-cultured with its host microalgae to determine whether this symbiotic system is suitable for purifying biogas and biogas slurry. Results showed that endophytic bacteria S395-1 and S395-2 belonged to different genera. Both strains promoted microalgae growth while improving photosynthetic performance, carbonic anhydrase activity, nutrient removal efficiency, and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. The optimal bacteria (S395-2)-to-microalgae ratio and co-culture duration were 10:1 and 7Â days. Under this condition, the growth rate and carbonic anhydrase activity were 0.196Â Â±Â 0.06 d<sup>-1</sup> and 31.24Â Â±Â 0.28 EU/cell, respectively. The symbiotic system had removal efficiencies of 88.29Â Â±Â 5.03%, 88.31Â Â±Â 4.29%, 88.21Â Â±Â 4.51%, and 68.13Â Â±Â 1.69% for chemical oxygen demand, nitrogen, phosphorus, and CO<sub>2</sub>, respectively. These results will provide a framework for constructing a microalgal-bacterial consortium that can improve wastewater treatment and enhance biogas quality.",Bioresource technology,2020,None,10.1016/j.biortech.2020.123766,1,"The article does not explicitly state whether the microalgae-bacteria consortium is used for product production. However, the consortium is said to improve wastewater treatment and enhance biogas quality, which could be used in product production."
