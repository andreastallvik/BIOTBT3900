# Case-study: Butanol production
Dynamic community metabolic modelling of a co-culture of *Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum* M5 and *Clostridium acetobutylicum* NJ4 from the publication [Consolidated bioprocessing performance of a two-species microbial consortium for butanol production from lignocellulosic biomass
](https://doi.org/10.1002/bit.27464).

## Project workflow

The main steps in this project were:

1. Automatic reconstruction of GEMs (CareveMe)
1. Model validation and curation (COBRApy)
1. Static modelling of individual strains (COBRApy)
1. Dynamic modelling of individual strains (COMETS)
1. Dynamic modelling of community (COMETS)

## Content overview

The GEM for the BiGG universal model, is located in the [../GEMs/](../GEMs/) folder.
The medium used for model reconstruction and simulation is in the [medium.tsv](medium.tsv) file.
The main results are presented in the notebooks [m5_sim.ipynb](m5_sim.ipynb), [nj4_sim.ipynb](nj4_sim.ipynb), and [community_sim.ipynb](community_sim.ipynb).
