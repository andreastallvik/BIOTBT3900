This directory is currently a bit of a mess, with very  many notebooks for different exploratory purposes.  

Most scripts and functions that are used in the final analysis can be found in the [functions](../RAsynthesis/functions/) folder.
In addition, scripts in [create_GEMS.py](create_GEMS.py) was used to generate the final GEMs, which are located in the [GEMs](../RAsynthesis/GEMs/) folder.

The main results are disrtibuted in 4 notebooks:

- [results_coculture.ipynb](community_modelling/RAsynthesis/results_coculture.ipynb)
- [results_glc_tri.ipynb](community_modelling/RAsynthesis/results_glc_tri.ipynb)
- [results_mixed_sub_tri_atp_adjusted.ipynb](community_modelling/RAsynthesis/results_mixed_sub_tri_atp_adjusted.ipynb)
- [results_mixed_sub_tri.ipynb](community_modelling/RAsynthesis/results_mixed_sub_tri.ipynb)
