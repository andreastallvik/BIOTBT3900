This notebooks and scripts in this directory were used to replicate results from [Balancing the non-linear rosmarinic acid biosynthetic pathway by modular co-culture engineering](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2019.03.002) using static and dynamic metabolic modelling methods.

Scripts and functions that are used in the final analysis can be found in the [functions](../RAsynthesis/functions/) folder.
In addition, functions in [create_GEMS.py](create_GEMS.py) was used to generate the final GEMs, which are located in the [GEMs](../RAsynthesis/GEMs/) folder.

The main results are disrtibuted in the following notebooks:

- [results_coculture.ipynb](../RAsynthesis/results_coculture.ipynb), for RAD2:RAU4 coculture simulation
- [results_glc_tri.ipynb](../RAsynthesis/results_glc_tri.ipynb), for CAL2:SAL9:MAM2 triculture simulation
- [results_mixed_sub_tri_atp_adjusted.ipynb](../RAsynthesis/results_mixed_sub_tri_atp_adjusted.ipynb), for CAL11:SAL11:MAM3 triculture simulation
